He's known for creating the running Facehugger mechanism, and inner Queen Alien animatronics for the Oscar-Winning ALIENS while working for Stan Winston Studio.

A graduate of Loyola Marymount University, Rick got his start at prop houses and working at Makeup Effects Labs, John Dykstra's Apogee, Richard Edlund's Boss Films, and Stan Winston Studio.
