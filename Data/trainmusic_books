3.0,Yet another spotty Chicago retrospective,"Another Chicago retrospective, this time an import.  Trouble is the same as ever.  The Columbia recordings far outshine the Warners years, leaving their '80s output seeming incredibly limp and middle-of-the-road.  Once they were an adventurous and risk-taking creative juggernaut embraced by both the AM-radio singles market and the FM-classic rock format.  By the '80s, however,  Chicago had devolved into an Adult Contemporary radio power ballad machine, becoming bland, less significant, and ever more meaningless with each new release.  Compilations such as this one drive that sad fact home all too often.  Three stars for the Columbia output featured.  Minus two stars for the mindless power ballad inclusions.",[],B082K5Z5G7,B082K5Z5G7,AE7BV6IMNPZ3F266H7PXMH3BZQNQ,2021-10-31 23:43:38.404,5,True,A detailed look at the secret lives of cats!
5.0,"The great, lost Brigati Brothers album","Eddie and David Brigati's lost masterpiece.  Why hasn't this classic Rascals side-bar story been reissued on CD?  It's easily the equal of ""Felix Cavaliere"" / ""Destiny,"" and far outshines ""Treasure."" That something as good as this remains unattainable in today's music marketplace is positively mindboggling.  I bought the LP back in 1976 (and I still own and play it!) after hearing the title track played by the late, great Scott ""Scotso"" Muni on the late, lamented WNEW-FM 102.7, where rock lived in those days.  While it was the title track that drew me in at first, the entire album grabbed hold of my musical soul and has never let go -- some 46 years on.  It's that good, yes!  C'mon, Rhino, this one's right in your Rascals lovin' wheelhouse.  Make ""Lost in The Wilderness"" available for people to fall in love with again -- or for the very first time.  Thanks for all the great music, Eddie & Dave, I highly recommend this one to everyone who loves music made with genuine care and feeling.

4.0,CSN's last best shining moment,"Daylight Again began as a duo project for Stephen Stills and Graham Nash, as David Crosby was in the throes of his legendary and debilitating drug addiction.  Atlantic Records passed on the duo concept and suggested that Stills and Nash should somehow work Croz into the project.  It was the group's last best hope.  Sales for the CSN trio's third LP together would surely outpace a SN duo release.  They did, and it did, and all was well, for a while anyway.  The album produced a pair of genuine hit singles (Nash's Wasted on the Way, Stills' Southern Cross) that pushed it up into the top ten charts and on to platinum sales certification.  The Cali soft-rock sound that stoked the album was right in the pocket for the times, and the Crosby contributions (Delta, Might as Well Have a Good Time) felt right in the mix, never mind that Art Garfunkel and Timothy B. Schmidt were all over the vocal harmonies throughout the project.  It was the last time an original CSN collection would be so well received.  Four stars from me and highly recommended.",[],B0872JR211,B0872JR211,AE7BV6IMNPZ3F266H7PXMH3BZQNQ,2022-08-01 19:48:34.292,0,False,Why can't all dictionaries be this much fun?
5.0,Succinctly Contagious,"Woo sung has made an ep that encapsulates this particular earthbound moment with humor, irony, and a little regret - all wrapped up in a 12 minute nonstop sing and dance-along. !!! this modern life, indeed.<br /><br />Seriously. In Phase Me, he taunts an ex-lover or someone he wishes were an ex. The melody and lyrics are less bombastic/more seductive than I Will Survive, but it’s a similar emotional vein. The narrator is at maximum incandescence and In the video is getting  a LOT of attention from uh people. Many people. And you kind of think, good for you- until you notice that the title is spelled PHASE. Which, if you like Woosung, takes you straight to Moon. And phases. And the message immediately changes. He’s great now, but it’s inevitable that the next phases will tend towards darkness before the light comes back. Which pulls you into the shadows despite how upbeat and catchy the song is on its face.<br /><br />Lightness and dark weave all through Moth; every song touches on both and on the need to protect one’s personal light from people and circumstances that would diminish or demolish it.<br /><br />And all things taken together, the dominant message seems to to one of defiance. In spite of past sadness. In spite of what’s after you. In spite of what is on the way.<br /><br />Highly recommend.",[],B09Y5MVL5M,B09Y5MVL5M,AENH6LSB6BM7XLPEYUL43WBOD6JA,2022-06-06 17:15:43.148,2,True,A Visual Tour Through History

5.0,A wonderfully funny and poignant story,"NOTE:  This review is based on reading the book, not listening to the audio version.<br /><br />In the second chapter of this book (actually labelled as ""3"" because this is the second prime number), we are introduced to Christopher, the narrator, who is writing a mystery novel as a class project. Christopher is an extremely intelligent 15-year old who just happens to be autistic. He begins his tale by relating his discovery of a neighbor's dog, which had been murdered with a garden fork. Because he likes both dogs and mysteries, Christopher sets off to find the killer, but what starts as a story about a dog becomes a story about Christopher's life. Not only do we learn about Christopher's many quirks, but also we learn the explanations for his seemingly irrational behavior, making it seem almost logical. The book is surprising funny, as Christopher, with his limited emotional range, makes the perfect straight man. As a psychologist, I found that the depiction of Christopher rang true, and overall, I found this novel to be a delightful, different, and quick little read.",[],1856868648,1856868648,AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,2006-06-30 12:58:41.000,3,False,Can't Put it Down!
5.0,Like a 'best of' from her Verve large orchestra albums,"It's hard to dislike this album, although there are better deals that document Anita's Verve Years. For one, I would go with [[ASIN:B005I4UMCO 8 Classic Albums]], which is slightly more expensive with a lot more tracks. However, this album contains some true gems.<br /><br />Since as of the date of this review there is no track listing for this album I am providing one (and their source albums).<br /><br />The first seven tracks, plus track 23 are from her 1958 album titled [[ASIN:B000WLVBBE Anita O'Day Sings The Winners]]. They are: Take the A Train, Early Autumn, Four Brothers, My Funny Valentine, Sing, Sing, Sing, What's Your Story Morning Glory, Peanut Vendor and Star Eyes.<br /><br />Track 8, Whisper Not, is from one of my favorite albums titled [[ASIN:B000V697T8 Anita O'Day And The Three Sounds]]. Sadly this is the only track that is from that amazing album.<br /><br />Stomping at the Savoy and Don't Be That Way (tracks 9 & 11) are from [[ASIN:B000V6728Q Pick Yourself Up]], while Hershey Bar (track 10) is from [[ASIN:B001NZJ3HW Cool Heat]] and Peel Me a Grape (track 12) is from [[ASIN:B000VRH2IU Time For Two]] (another album I absolutely love and wish was better represented in this collection.)<br /><br />Tracks 13-21 are from [[ASIN:B000WLQKHO Swings Cole Porter]], consisting of Just One of Those Things, Love for Sale, Easy to Love, I Get a Kick Out of You, What Is This Thing Called Love, Night and Day, Get Out of Town, I've Got You Under My Skin, and De-Lovely. Somehow the producer managed to include every one of my favorites!<br /><br />Interestingly, the next-to-last track - Honeysuckle Rose - is from her first Verve album, [[ASIN:B00000470I This Is Anita]].<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid collection of Anita's Verve years, and are drawn from albumsnext-to-last that are more centered on orchestral arrangements and backing (two exceptions are tracks 8 and 12.)

5.0,Early Klook with some gems,"This album contains some rare tracks spanning the period between 1946 and 1950. As I write this review it's out-of-print, but fortunately still available as Disc Six in a 10-disc set titled [[ASIN:B005D4XYUQ Kind of Clarke]].<br /><br />Sadly there are no sound samples on this page. It would be presumptuous of me to attempt to describe the songs comprising these tracks because such descriptions would only reflect my personal tastes and biases. I can, however, provide detailed information regarding when, where and my whom each track was recorded. That information will give you some idea as to the music itself based on the signature sounds of the musicians in the sessions.<br /><br />The first four tracks were recorded in NY on September 5, 1946 and feature Kenny Dorham and Fats Navarro on trumpet, Sonny Stitt on alto sax, Ray Abrams on tenor sax, Eddie DeVerteuil on baritone sax, Bud Powell on piano, John Collins on guitar, Al Hall on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.<br /><br />Tracks 5-7 are Kenny Clarke Sextet, recorded in Paris on March 2, 1948 and feature Benny Bailey on trumpet, John Brown on alto sax, Cecil Payne on baritone sax, Ralph Schecroun on piano, Al McKibbon on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.<br /><br />Tracks 8-11 were recorded in Paris on May 4, 1948 as the the Kenny Clarke Orchestra. Personnel are: Dick Collins on trumpet, Hubert Fol on alto sax, Jean-Claude Fohrenbach on tenor sax, Andre Hodeir under the pseudonym of ""Claude Laurence"" on violin, Jacques Denjean on piano, Charles Montaggioni on guitar, Alf Masselier on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.<br /><br />Tracks 12 through 15 were recorded in Paris on May 5, 1948 as the Michel De Villers et Son Orchestre comprised of Claude Dunson on trumpet, Michel De Villers on alto sax, Jean-Claude Fohrenbach on tenor sax, Jacques Denjean on piano, Charles Montaggioni on guitar, Alf Masselier on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.<br /><br />Tracks 16-19 were recorded in Paris on October 29, 1949 as the Hubert Fol et ses Be-Bop Minstrels. This group was comprised of Nat Peck on trombone, Hubert Fol on alto sax, Bernard Peiffer on piano, Jean Bouchety on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.<br /><br />Final two tracks were recorded in Paris on June 7, 1950 as Kenny Clarke and his Orchestra. Personnel on this session were: Nat Peck on trombone, Hubert Fol on alto sax, James Moody on tenor sax, Gerald Wiggins on piano, Pierre Michelot on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.<br /><br />If you are a Klook fan this album documents an important period of his playing approximately a decade after he went professional.

As I write this review the other formats offered - MP3 Music 39 Songs 2010 and Audio CD 2011 - are for different products that are not the same as this album.<br /><br />What makes this album great is it's a sampler that contains six tracks each for six truly great ladies in jazz. I'll list the contents of each disc below.<br /><br />Of course the choices are not going to satisfy everyone. For example, it would have been great had one of my favorites been included - Anita O'Day or Maxine Sullivan - and Dinah Washington is better known as an R&B artist. On the other hand, one cannot argue with either the choices made since each vocalist is one of the greats, or the tracks which do showcase their talents. And as for Ms. Washington: although she was often billed as the Queen of the Blues, she was also one great jazz singer. Her tracks on this album prove that.<br /><br />Here is what the set contains:<br /><br />DISC ONE:<br />=============<br />Sarah Vaughan<br />=============<br />01.  Lullaby of Birdland<br />02.

Sweet Georgia Brown<br /><br />As you can see, the tracks are familiar. But that is what makes this a great sampler: familiar songs performed by some of the best ever jazz vocalists.

5.0,First album veering towards pop,"Note that this album is out of print, but is part of a value-priced set titled [[ASIN:B00CSFXQZ6 8 Classic Albums]] as the first ten tracks on Disc Four.<br /><br />This 1962 album contains tracks that clearly show Lewis' strategy to move from a jazz piano trio format to more popular music (perhaps in response to Ray Charles' success in crossing over from R&B to pop.) The first five tracks on the album have a string section backing the trio.<br /><br />While the first five tracks comprising Side A is a foray into pop, Side B is still heavily rooted in jazz. The album has a consistent theme - Spring - and Lewis contributed three compositions to reinforce that theme. He wrote A1, A3 and B1, and B5 was written by bassist Eldee Young.

Fascinating Rhythm<br />02. Why Do I Love You?<br />03. It's Only Sunshine<br />04. Love Letters<br />05. Let's Get Away from It All<br />06. Flying Home<br />07. I'll Remember April<br />08.

Solacium<br />==========<br />DISC TWO<br />==========<br />The first 8 tracks is the album titled [[ASIN:B000QZRMCI Flute Fraternity with Herbie Mann and Buddy Collette]] and the remaining tracks is the album originally titled Sultry Serenade, but is now issued as [[ASIN:B0055WHK92 Let Me Tell You]].<br />01. Herbie's Buddy<br />02. Perdido<br />03. Bangles and Beads Baubles<br />04. Give a Little Whistle<br />05. Here's Pete<br />06. Theme from 'Theme From'<br />07. Nancy with the Laughing Face<br />08.

One Morning In May<br />16. Swing Til the Girls Come Home<br />==========<br />DISC THREE<br />==========<br />The first four tracks are from the album titled Flute Souffle, but are now found on the same Let Me Tell you album cited for the previous disc. The remaining tracks on this disc are the album titled [[ASIN:B002G6ESH2 Yardbird Suite]].<br />01. Tel Aviv<br />02. Somewhere Else<br />03. Let's March<br />04. Chasin' the Bird<br />05. Yardbird Suite<br />06. Here's That Man<br />07. One for Tubby<br />08. Squire's Parlor<br />09. Who Knew<br />10. Opicana<br />==========<br />DISC FOUR<br />==========<br />The first six tracks are the album titled [[ASIN:B000000Z2L Just Wailin]] and the remaining tracks are the album titled [[ASIN:B000W178WA Flautista! Herbie Mann Plays Afro-Cuban Jazz]]. Note, that album contains bonus tracks that are not on this one.<br />01. Minor Groove<br />02. Gospel Truth<br />03. Blue Echoes<br />04. Trinidad<br />05. Jumpin' with Symphony Sid<br />06. Blue Dip<br />07. Todos Loco's<br />08. Cuban Potato Chip<br />09. Come On Mule<br />10. The Amazon River<br />11. Caravan<br /><br />Note that this is identical to an MP3 album that contains all 53 tracks in the same order, so if you want immediate gratification check it out: [[ASIN:B00EE7SQ7O The Jazz Collection Volume One]]. Even if you opt for physical discs visit that page and listen to the sound samples for an idea of both the sound quality and the music.<br /><br />Overall this is a great collection of Herbie's work at the height of his pure jazz period. He would continue to grow and experiment musically - sometimes in ways that lost him fans - but if you like the earlier period this set is golden.",[],B00C9RCUSC,B00C9RCUSC,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2013-09-04 16:56:51.000,0,False,He really loved it.

4.0,"Not exactly Hollywood, but a high energy jam session in nearby Inglewood","This album was recorded mere weeks after Chet Baker and Bird were 'home recorded' at the same venue. Like that album - [[ASIN:B005MVLS94 Bird & Chet: Live at the Trade Winds, 1952]], the sound quality on this one is not spectacular, but the music is. In fact some of the same musicians from the earlier session are on this one.<br /><br />Sadly there are no sound samples on this page at the time of this review. In a nutshell, this is mainly a horn-centric session with a young Chet Baker playing a lot more aggressively than he would on subsequent albums. There are two tracks where the ensemble downshifts and gives Al Haig a lot of room and places him in the front line: I'll Remember April and Sweet Georgia Brown.<br /><br />Here are the tracks:<br />1. There'll Never Be Another You<br />2. Bernie's Tune<br />3. My Old Flame<br />4. Avalon<br />5. I'll Remember April<br />6. How High The Moon<br />7. Sweet Georgia Brown<br /><br />If you love energetic music this is a great album. It was recorded live at the Trade Winds Club in Inglewood (a Los Angeles suburb) on August 4, 1952 and features the following line-up:<br /><br />Chet Baker on trumpet with Ted Ottison on trumpet on tracks 5 and 7, Sonny Criss on alto on tracks 1, 3 and 7, Jack Montrose on tenor sax on tracks 1, 4 and 7, Les Thompson on harmonica on track 4, and a rhythm section comprised of Al Haig on piano, Dave Bryant on bass and Larry Bunker on drums.",[],B000GEW86E,B000GEW86E,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2013-10-19 10:58:03.000,4,False,My GoTo Book!
5.0,"Not all of the Trio sessions, but all are early LaFaro","This album is really a double album set that is  [[ASIN:B003OFC2SG SINGS WITH THE PAT MORAN TRIO]] with the trio comprised of Patti Moran [McCoy] on piano, Scott LaFaro on bass and Gene Gammage on drums backing Beverly Kelly on vocals, and [[ASIN:B004FBEQN2 This is Pat Moran]] featuring just the trio. Both albums are listed in various discographies as being recorded in December 1957, although the trio-only one is claimed by Moran-McCoy to have been recorded a year later. Not disputed is both were recorded in New York.<br /><br />Here are some discrepancies that make these an incomplete collection of the trio recordings: Track 20 does not show up in discographies, including the one dedicated to these two albums that span pages 262 through 264 in Lafaro's biography written by his sister: [[ASIN:1574412736 Jade Visions: The Life and Music of Scott LaFaro]]. Also missing from this album are Spring is Here and This Love of Mine, both of which are from the Kelly album, and Stella by Starlight, When Your Lover Has Gone and Farewells from the Trio album.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this does not contain all the tracks from the trio sessions, it does contain a record of LaFaro's genius even at 21. That alone merits five stars in my opinion in spite of some missing tracks.<br /><br />All discographies that I have checked, including LaFaro's biography cited above confirm that LaFaro was, in fact, the bassist and Gammage the drummer on all tracks.<br /><br />Sadly there are no sound samples here, nor on the Kelly album page, but there are on the Trio page, which will give you a good idea of the music on this album. If you are a bassist, jazz historian or musicologist, or a LaFaro fan this album is a treasure despite the discrepancies.",[],B000VPP00O,B000VPP00O,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2013-12-18 14:39:51.000,0,False,Our Go To Book

5.0,Playful Chemistry,It is difficult to imagine how two people who could create such ecstasy with their voices would no longer be talking.

5.0,Having Great Luck with Hypnosis CDs - Rachael Eccles Is My Favorite!,"I'm fairly new to hypnosis CDs. Mostly I've used them in the past to get to sleep faster and found them effective. I prayed and prayed that I would lose some weight and the answer seems to be to get some hypnosis CDs and retrain my thinking about eating and exercising.<br /><br />Since I've been using weight loss hypnosis CDs I've exercised nearly every day and changed some of my eating habits. It therefore seems worth it to devote time to hypnosis instead of reading more books about weight loss because really what you are dealing with is the subconscious mind and how it has been programed. We all know what is good and bad in the food world, but often we just don't have the self control to make the right choices.<br /><br />This CD is excellent for its deep relaxation visualizations. If you can darken your room, turn off lights, get into bed with a warm comforter or heating blanket you will find it much easier to fall deeply into hypnosis. Make sure that no one disturbs you. Tell people in your home that you are going to be unavailable for as long as it takes to do one, two or three of these hypnosis sessions. I like doing all three because I find that the most effective way to relax.<br /><br />The first hypnosis session on this CD is a waking hypnosis which means you will go deep into relaxation, then have helpful thoughts put into your subconscious and will be told to awaken at the end. The second session is just for 5 minutes and can be used when you are short on time but need some positive reinforcement. The last session is a hypnosis which guides you through similar images to the first one, with a little change here or there. You are left to fall asleep to calming music at the end. So perfect to listen to in the evening when you are going to bed.<br /><br />Rachael Eccles really has a gift for helping people solve all their problems. I've been trusting her to solve a lot of mine lately! She truly wants to guide you to a place where you are more in control of your life and are not leaving things just up to chance. I think a lot of overeating is stress related and this helps you feel a sense of calm and serenity so you can be more aware of your choices each day.<br /><br />I found this CD has some really beautiful visualizations especially the garden and hammock that take you deep into a world of relaxing hypnosis. I've tried another weight loss hypnosis CD and they all help, but this one is my current favorite because it makes me also feel way less stress. After listening I feel centered and motivated to lose weight.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],1785872710,1785872710,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2022-03-19 00:51:39.355,3,True,"The crucial first year!

5.0,"Wotchit, Tosh! Clash at their best!!","Brilliance!<br />Clash at the peak of their game with a heartfelt 'I fought the law' - reportedly recorded just after the 'guns on the roof' arrest, ""Capital radio"" (not 'capitol radio' which was a re-recording.....and done for (I think Kenny Everret Show?), and the two songs hanging over from 101'ers and London SS....'Gates of the West' and ""Groovy Times"" - which don't show up anyplace else very often.<br />ANYWAY - if you're a Clash aficionado, i don't need to rabbit on about the wonder of this EP, if you're not a Clash fan.....you're unlikely to care anyway.<br />But for those of us who were there at the Electric Circus in Manchester, or wherever you caught Clash gigging.....THIS raw sounding (but not live) set is a wonderful trip down punk memory lane.<br />Watchout for all the gobbin' down in the front row...........:-)","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yJpMpRLQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yJpMpRLQL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yJpMpRLQL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B004TNJO9C,B004TNJO9C,AH7UKE3JVRDLDME7ZEDCPVF7QS5Q,2011-03-26 19:47:03.000,1,False,A Passion of Mine
5.0,Overlooked Masterpiece,"Having been unable to find this issued on CD, I'm forced to listen to either a recording of this on a cassette of my vinyl (to keep from wearing out my vinyl) or the vinyl it's self. I'm not a big fan of downloads or manufactured on demand CD's either so...while I did download this, I don't think I'll be doing much more of it.<br />I purchased the LP when it was first issued. The sound on the vinyl is 10 times better than the MP3 download but, it's better than nothing.<br />After almost 40 years of listening, this is still one of my favorites by Steve Miller. While this isn't a ""top 40"" release, there are some great cuts on this LP. One half the LP is live, the other studio. The title cut (Rock Love) could easily been released as a single and probably would have done well for the time. I love all the blues cuts on the LP and while this is a pared down unit for Steve Miller, this LP will suprise you. With repeated listenings, I find it to be more and more one of my favorites of his and the only thing I find wrong with it is that it's one of his shorter LP's. With only 8 total cuts. Harbor Lights is probably my favorite cut but, honestly, there are NO BAD CUTS on this LP.",[],B004I2F6JG,B004I2F6JG,AHZ547XWV2I5OBJ5FO2ZQ7JWR6QA,2011-10-19 12:02:49.000,3,False,Read it Three Times Already!!!
