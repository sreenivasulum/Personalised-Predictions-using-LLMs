5.0,A Great Mozart Specialist,"I have always considered these concerti to be the pinnacle of Mozart's great skills as a composer: they bring together his fine orchestrations, his operatic sense for the soloist, his great ability to develop classical forms, and his flair as a pianist. At the same time, I had not yet found a set of performances that fully satisfied me. I owned three prior to this one. The main thing is that the melodies seem so beautiful that it is not enough for a pianist to play them well. I need something more.<br />This seems to be the set I was looking for. Zacharias deserves his reputation as a Mozart specialist. He plays every phrase in an interesting way. He is like a reader who does not simply make sure to catch each word, but seeks to give each phrase its own place in the unfolding drama. I have heard most of these works many times, and I constantly find myself struck by the freshness of his reading. All the more impressive that he also conducting: the orchestra sounds wonderful, like an extension of the soloist.",[],B016C57VTY,B016C57VTY,AE3EZXD5PAAWZXC4VYMHLYGIFVNQ,2020-09-06 18:32:06.290,1,True,Aloha Burgers

3.0,Disappointing,"I was somewhat disappointed by these performances. Her voice may be beautiful, but her approach lacks musicality. In particular, the pronunciation of Italian is so poor that it actually harms the music. Not that I care much about the words, but when Italian is pronounced with such a heavy American accent, it ceases to be a language with any rhythm.

5.0,Why so expensive?,"My only reason for not loving this is the price. It would seem that these fine recordings have turned into something of a collector's item. Why? One possible reason: you would have a hard time finding any other works of classical music that are of such high stature and significance, but so seldom recorded. I mean, do a search and compare this to how many recordings there are of Bach's cello suites or Mozart's Haydn quartets.<br /><br />So I bit the bullet and paid the price. Not disappointed.

5.0,"Impressive, ambitious undertaking","This is my first taste of this set of complete works for keyboard performed by Abelard. It seems to be an incredibly ambitious undertaking, to perform all of these works on period instruments of the most authentic sort, grouped by chronology as well as theme. The first thing that stands out here is the utterly stunning sound of the harpsichord on the first two discs. (The third disc is organ.) But also the musicianship, very quickly paced and rhythmically vibrant playing. And the liner notes really give a fresh glimpse on Bach's approach to transcribing concerti by other composers as solo keyboard works. This set seems to set a new high watermark for Bach on period keyboard, which is something I do not say lightly, given the fine work of Scott Ross and Ton Koopman. One can only await what will happen as he gets into some of the bigger works for keyboard.",[],B08M8CRK7H,B08M8CRK7H,AE3EZXD5PAAWZXC4VYMHLYGIFVNQ,2021-04-26 22:23:17.217,1,True,Understanding Emotional Abuse in Marriage and What To Do About It!
5.0,Amazed how good,"Please note: Jarrett recorded this work on both harpsichord and piano. This is the piano version.<br />I unwittingly bought the piano version of Book I and the Harpsichord version of Book II. But this provided a nice chance to compare, if not the same pieces on two instruments, at least a sense of his playing on both.<br />While I find both outstanding, I was surprised to find the harpsichord the more natural and rhythmically fluid. Now I think I need both versions of each!<br />While I have been listening to Bach's keyboard works for years, I always resisted the WTC mainly because it seemed more like practice or technical demonstration than music that could just be enjoyed on its own terms. But I recently got into trying to find a really listenable, enjoyable version of this music. My sense is that this is one of the very best (this or the harpsichord version by same). I have also enjoyed Richter, who takes a more dramatic approach. What I find so good about Jarrett's approach is that he instinctively finds the right tempo for each piece, which really lets the music develop and shine. Rather than just rushing through, he allows you to hear the melody and rhythm of each piece. The music breaths. It is kind of unfair that Jarrett has been both the greatest jazz pianist of his era, and also outdone some very fine musicians who devoted their whole careers to Bach.",[],B0000260BE,B0000260BE,AE3EZXD5PAAWZXC4VYMHLYGIFVNQ,2021-05-25 14:39:41.808,1,True,A Compassionate and Caring Guide to Dealing with the Unique Qualities of BPD!
5.0,"Yes, one of the great recordings","This joins some of the best jazz live box sets in my collection (Plugged Nickel, Coltrane at Village Vanguard). Six sets of one of the greatest musical minds of the era. On each set, some very solid, pretty, clever tunes, and most sets have one longer improvisation that stands out. For example, a 25 plus minute take on Autumn leaves. Almost no repetition between sets--new material each time (I also appreciate when you get to hear improvisers do different things with the same tune, but here the sheer variety is also impressive). Sound quality incredible. The longer pieces just really show what an incredible improviser Keith Jarrett can be--not to downplay the rest of the band, as they really think with one mind here. I also hear some phases where they diverge and compete for attention--part of the appeal.<br />Now as for the complaints of others I say: yes, but who cares. Is there a great deal of applause? Yes. But it is following some of the greatest recorded jazz you will ever hear, so live with it or just admit that you really don't value music that much. Also, yes, each set is uneven. Something is incredible and something else just clever and pretty. But that is the flow of a live jazz performance. If you could just have the best of the best from this, it would be about two hours or so, but it is more worthwhile to hear the band go through different moods and different valleys and peaks. It's not all on the same level in the same way that anything real and organic, like a good conversation, has to go through different phases to get to the great parts. It can't all be dessert.",[],B000024JEX,B000024JEX,AE3EZXD5PAAWZXC4VYMHLYGIFVNQ,2021-09-25 16:52:28.888,4,True,The foremost authority on Santiago de Compostela tells all
4.0,Weaker effort from a great band,"I have all the recordings from this trio. This latest one is the weakest so far. Sometimes these ECM jazz bands tend to be a bit too 'cool', bleak and modern. Usually this band is one of the best trios, because they can alternate between a more bleak atonal sound and a more 'hot' sound from track to track. On this album, but on this album, it never quite kicks into gear. I would recommend any of the other albums, 'Trio', Live, Sparks of Life or January, as some of the best trio jazz out there.",[],B09BK7KDYY,B09BK7KDYY,AE3EZXD5PAAWZXC4VYMHLYGIFVNQ,2021-10-18 22:24:30.908,1,True,Engrossing read that brought back train memories of my own!

5.0,Great recording of two concerts,"This has become one of my favorite Jarrett solo recordings recently. I think I see why it was not released for so long, and it is not the quality of the music or the quality of the recording, but a somewhat awkward length. The Munich concert is amazing throughout but it is too long for a single disc or lp, and the Bregenz recording is not quite long enough for what ECM was usually releasing. I'd place the music itself up there with some of the great ones--especially the first part of the Munich concert. This is not the most abstruse or difficult Jarrett, but he does form big, beautiful, soulful structures. I like it more than Bremen-Lausanne.",[],B00FCAJZEK,B00FCAJZEK,AE3EZXD5PAAWZXC4VYMHLYGIFVNQ,2022-10-06 20:53:05.734,0,True,"Another solid, well-written entry on the Mediterranean diet"

5.0,Forgotten Classic,"Go Go Harlem Baby was released about 20 years ago. It contains some of Dexter and Crow's best music, recorded in Sun Studios with the legendary Jim Dickinson producing and playing on some tracks. The CD covers the range of Dexter's unique musical vision, from the taut, bluesy guitar work on Stalkin' to impassioned '50's rockabilly torch singing on ""Love has It's Jokes Sometimes"" to the existential questions raised on the Kurt Weil-ish ""Ask Me How I Live"" to the jazzy, melancholy instrumental ""Harlem Nocturne"" to the old time sincerity of ""Apple Blossom Time."" Dexter and Crow's music in the Flat Duo Jets was crude and harsh by definition, but there was also real subtlety and depth in their playing. Dexter has always had an emotional open-ness that few artists can equal. Cat Power, another artist of real honesty and true emotional intensity has been a fan of Dexter's for many years, and one listen to ""Go Go Harlem Baby"" shows why. Dexter is a roots rock Van Gogh, painting his agony and ecstasy in songs and instrumentals that blaze with color and passion. Dex's music transcends all categories and he is still making records like ""Ruins of Berlin"" that just get better and better.",[],B004JU13OY,B004JU13OY,AE4F7MJAZ74SHBH7G4SOOYZAOIXA,2012-08-02 20:04:22.000,0,False,Faithful adaptation of Worrisome Heart

The 32+minute main track ""The Creator Has a Masterplan"" begins as a funky, melodic jam for about 7 minutes, then vocalist Leon Thomas sings some verses, before the band enter a long free jazz exploration with Thomas ululating in ways that recall Tim Buckley on Starsailor. The collective improvisation is like nothing else I have heard in jazz. Everyone merges in a dense sonic stew that goes out into cosmic chaos and returns to the serene melodic feel of the intro with nothing like a ""solo"" performance anywhere. When Pharaoh plays extended breaks, his sax is always enfolded in the unity of the group and this creates a truly spiritual sense of ""All is One, One is All"". I can listen to this album on repeat and always find new smiles. For me, this is one of the top 5 jazz records of all time, alongside Kind of Blue and A Love Supreme.",[],B000003N7C,B000003N7C,AE4F7MJAZ74SHBH7G4SOOYZAOIXA,2022-03-26 15:07:04.065,1,True,A gorgeous cookbook that inspires appreciation
5.0,Fantastic Sound Quality and Timeless Musical Healing,"This Japanese import took 3 weeks to arrive, but the sound is far superior to American CD's and worth the wait. Every instrument is crystal clear and fully present in the mix. The 5-minute Cecil McBee bass solo, ""Love"", reveals dense textures and resonances, like he's playing live in the room. The delayed Fender Rhodes chords on ""Astral Travelling"", are full of gorgeous tone colors. As other reviewers point out, Thembi offers many contrasts of mood and sound. After the drifting acid-jazz opener, a squawking, shrieking blast of free jazz illuminates ""Red, Green and Black"". After the first abrasive onslaught, Pharaoh finds a groove and the hurricane resolves into a flow of multi-tonal sound. Pharoah uses chaos as a dynamic element in a larger, holistic vision, it's never just atonality for its own sake. There is always a sense that this creator has a master plan and is leading us through darkness and disorder into light and peace. The screams in Pharoah's sax often hauntingly evoke the suffering and horror of slavery while carrying the listener on a massive tide of spiritual strength and endurance that conquers all. ""Thumb"" and ""Bailophone Dance"" layer African percussion, keyboards, flute and soprano sax and ""Morning Prayer"" is a sustained, peaceful meditation. Nothing here is extraneous or out of place -- trust the Pharoah.",[],B08N3JG2XK,B08N3JG2XK,AE4F7MJAZ74SHBH7G4SOOYZAOIXA,2022-11-03 13:35:42.233,0,True,This is a beautiful book full of unique treasures to discover and loads of rare photos and quotes

This record came in with I think a poster that the powers that be deemed unacceptable, along with Heart's new album ""Barracuda"" etc, and ""Who's Next"" that my supervisor hated.  The Kinks were on heavy rotation during my shift and I bought my copy and have been listening ever since.

Saw them twice in one tour in the early 70's and twice more.  Loud and no better guitar during that period.  Have all their studio albums now on CD and listen to them regularly.  This is the go to Led Zeppelin Music of my days just out of High School and They still are appreciated by me as much as then.  Stairway to Heaven and Black Dog are still played on the music delivery media and now all generations since they put this music out in Nov. 1971, my first year in the Army.  Helped us put up with that military rigor mortis of the love of life and Germany was where I saw them live, but can't remember if it was the third or fourth time going to one of their shows.  At that time they toured constantly.  A good stage appearance hair and the 70's clothing of the Generation.  Everyone should have seen them at least once.

4.0,Mandatory Fun by Al Yankovic,"I'll quickly recommend my favorite music to someone, but Mandatory Fun by Al Yankovic is something someone will have to decide for themselves they want to buy to have.  Since he did the parody of Michael Jackson's Beat It and for sometime before that I have been a fan.  Do I think he is great, no!  He's just kinda great.  But I like him like I like the origional Cheech and Chong Big Bambu album.  It was a classic humor offering.  I laugh out loud at Weird Al.  I do not get inspired by his work and neither do I vocally act out his routine.  Al does it so no one can do it or tell a joke off it any better.  It is Al's stuff and only a fool would try to do him.  He does others and then hands them their ego afterwards.  He is, the best at this and I don't think anyone out there has come before or ever will follow after him that could do it better.  I sure don't remember but a couple entertainers that makes me laugh any more than him.  This DVD offering is a hoot and if you need a laugh, do it.

4.0,Yes by Jason Mraz,"This new offering from Jason Mraz and his co-writers and contributors - Chaska Potter, Mona Tavakoli, Becky Gebhardt, Mike Mogis, Mai Bloomfield, Chris Keup, Stewart Myers - naming them in this review is my making up for my considering an albums as being performed by an individual, rather than the group of performers it really is. These are groups of people and instruments, where all the composing done is contributed by all.  For one to produce the overall sound, he would have to over dub more than even Cat Stevens.  Jason Mraz is a wonderful talent and a very special musician / songwriter, but this composition is like an orchestra's efforts to produce a wonderful sound from a written piece, where each part of the orchestra contributes to the final result.  All these people are as much a part of this album as is Mraz is himself.  I'm sure Jason Mraz would agree here.  Mraz's vocals and guitar work here, is not just the dominant theme of this albums alone.  He is still the wonderful voice and personality of the songs and music, but here where the major influence is a shared effort, for the direction of the songs so that each person gives so much to the whole of this music.  When Jason sings ""Quiet"", he really steps out and the influence he has brought in the past, but here the backing vocals are also so important to this song, that with out it, it would be only a small effort on his part.  As such, the other songs benefit even more from these beautiful voices who support this music.  If you have been a Jason Mraz fan, from his beginnings and are in awe of his talents and know of the far reaching effect of his career around the wodrld, the long roads he travels, you can appreciate his experiences he draws on for his music. These songs are combined with his love of life to bring out more of his life, than just a talented guy singing songs.  The old Jason from ""Rocket"" is there, in the back of this music and as he's matured and achieved more, he is now becoming a more complete musician.  I Enjoy all these new songs and understand Jason Mraz has changed his game.  He is evolving and will surely change even more.  Oh, some nice guitar still is in there for you to appreciate also, but the vocals are just wonderful.

It is a double Albumn and I don't think any of these songs ever were very popular or played on the radio, during the time they were performing as a group.

3.0,The Association's Greatest Hits,"I listened to this music in High School in the late 60's.  Group vocal bands were evolving away from this style of vocal and musical presentation and I just wanted to revisit the popular cuts of the time to see if I still had any of that era left in me.  Well, it did bring back some thoughts of the friends, female, I had at the time.  Sadly, they were into the local flavor of music, Country, and I couldn't seem to interest them in this stuff.  It is very soft, fairy tale music of the young lovers heartthrob music, that some would now refer to elevator music.  Regardless, I can still listen to it, even though I have moved on to more modern sounds of Dave, Dan and John, I been experiencing since the mid nineties.  A similar sound was around in the late 70's with America and a few other groups, but this sound fits in the softer middle of the group bands of the late 60's, the Byrds and Rascals sound familiar to this sound, just more rocky.  This music is so soft it can be compared to the Moody Blues, before they matured into a stage soft rock sound.  Anyhow, I still like them, but it is a little light in the loafers, for today's man.",[],B000002KAR,B000002KAR,AE5VPKX64CVOPH6X75C7EQXAIGLA,2015-01-16 20:17:48.000,0,True,Should You Leave or Should You Stay?

Some of these songs are not your best option, rather just a showcase for you to do your thing.  I give it 3 stars and will continue to listen to get a solid opinion of what you have done here.

4.0,Southeastern by Jason Isbell,"I've listened to Jason Isbell for a while now and this new music is some of his finest.  I like the way this album starts and builds through out the duration of the dozen cuts and ends wonderfully with his Relatively Easy.  His soft renditions of the first three songs is soothing lead in for the mesmerizing vocals of Elephant. Nothing said here offends me and only make me want more.  Sad and wonderful.  If this isn't Jason's best work, someone point out the ones which I have missed.!<br />As a singer and player, I don't require Jason Isbell to be any more than he is here.  His songs reflect a life experienced person and this person can sing and play.  His voice is another matter.  I think it compares favorably with almost any other vocalist I listen to, but when you play your own music  and then do it as well as Mr. Isbell does, putting these feelings of life lived and travels of his past for those willing to listen.  I imagine the words there on paper, of his emotions scrawled for these songs.  I just can't ask for anything more in the music I listen to.

3.0,NITTY GRITTY DIRT BAND - Greatest Hits,"I purchased this CD, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Greatest Hits, as a compilation of their music for my collection.  I had just heard a live Jerry Jeff Walker presentation of Mr. Bojangles, on a video with Todd Snider and Jason Isbell and got caught up in the moment.  I knew the Dirt Band had made it famous back in the days of my youth and I wanted to revisit that time.  This 60's version of the style of music played here, is a combination of popular music of the time and flat out country, without the twang than surrounds the southern presentation of country.  I still listen to music from the 60's and 70's more than more recent music, and this was one of the more popular groups of that era.  They do some of their own music on this Greatest Hits List, such as their first hit Buy for Me the Rain  and also includes a Kenny Loggins favorite, The House at Pooh Corner, as Loggins wrote four songs for the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, which went into their Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy album.  Many others have presented versions of this style and have done well after this band warmed them up.  Pure Prairie League and the Ozark Mtn. Daredevils come to mind, though both of these bands sound more country than The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.  This is dated music and if you weren't there, you may want to visit this era when all music, just about, had evolved from down home renderings and people later split their distinctions into country pop and full out country of today.  The lords of country music still determine who and what is country and now after years claim this band as their own again.

I won't say it is the best but I do like David Crosby's voice and he surrounds himself with Jeff Pevar, and Crosby's son, pianist James Raymond.  The vocals from this group is unique in that Crosby carries the load and is strong in this regard.  Pevar's work on guitar is good and Ramond is very capable on the keys.  The songs aren't that strong  and even though it is better than some of Crosby's other solo albums, it just lacks some of what I expect from his collaborations.

If you like music, regardless of your favorite genere, Willie's music is his and he is so unique among his piers that he is legend.

This compilation of music is not for everyone, unless you just like music that is written and performed by someone who was made to do so and does it well.  Maybe Steve isn't an Icon to all music lovers, but I am sure those fans out there are as appreciative of his songs as any fans.  His dated songs and delivery is a genuine as any musician and he is good a what he does.  I really like this compilation and listen to it regularly.

The vocals, his and the others in the recordings, are good and I pretty much like every cut.  He and the musicians around him continue to impress me.  As to his previous offerings, I have two, and after Southeastern, this is now my second favorite. I really consider his music to not be country, rather an American sound of Americana and popular sounding small town music.

The third disc included here is a DVD of a BBC in-concert broadcast from 1970, never seen in America.  This post-Lovin' Spoonful period should have been huge (commercially) for Sebastian and Reprise, especially in the wake of his high-profile association with the Woodstock event and film.  That only his JBS solo debut proved to be a solid commercial success (in spite of a label battle between MGM and Reprise) remains a bit of a head-scratcher.

And what a homecoming it was!  Some 51 years down the line, it stands as the best of her live albums, even if it languished in the vaults for 25 of those years before finally seeing the light of day.  From the I Feel the Earth Move opener, to the (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman closer, it's one highlight after another for both the artist and her enraptured hometown audience.

4.0,Single disc version of John Denver's Wildlife Concert,"Half-of his double-disc Wildlife Concert release, The Best of John Denver Live is a bit of a misnomer.  There are a lot of hits in the 16-song track list, yes.  But a lot of well-known Denver favorites are missing and replaced with less essential deep cuts.  Docked one star for that slight.  Quibbling, I know.  Regardless, it's a nicely packaged representation of the late singer / songwriter's concert program, played by an exceptional band and sung by a late-career John Denver in very good voice, indeed.

Crosby absolutely shines here (Carry Me alone is an absolute wonder and worth the price of admission), and Nash is right in the pocket throughout (his Fieldworker seems more relevant than ever, some 46 years down the line).  The title track joint effort (no pun intended) is as good as anything CSNY has ever attempted to put down on tape.  Wind on the Water (the album), incidentally, outpaced and outsold the Stills-Young Band's Long May You Run LP, released almost concurrently.

Absolutely killer band, interesting set-list (although it could've used a couple of Nash's familiar hits to balance things out a bit), and Crosby & Nash at the top of their vocal duo game.  For anyone who still thinks that it was strictly the Stills - Young artistic fireworks that consistently drove the CSNY mothership, I'd suggest taking a serious listen to this concert album.  Believe me when I say that David and Graham were definitely NOT missing Stephen and Neil on this tour!

3.0,The Stills-Young Band?  Not really.,"Listened to Crosby-Nash's classic Wind on the Water all the way through recently, then decided to give its mirror duo's mid '70s effort a spin.  It was an effort to get through it all (nine tracks), but I did.  The only truly memorable song included here is Young's Long May You Run, a genuine '70s classic.  The rest is a very musically schizophrenic affair that veers back and forth between Young's country-rock stoner jams and Stills' white guy BLOOZE misadventures.  The parts never jell into a solid whole, so you never quite get the feeling of a Stills-Young Band -- no such entity in evidence here, really.  Two-and-one-half stars, as opposed to the five stars I gave to the ""lesser two CSNY talents"" effort, released at almost the same time.

That clear-eyed voice that soared on such memorable tracks as A Good Feelin' to Know, Let's Dance Tonight, Crazy Eyes, Fallin' in Love, and so many other country-rock classics, hasn't lost a step.  While it would certainly have been nice to hear some newly written Furay compositions, this covers collection stands as a heartfelt testament to the sense of fun, power, and joy that continues to emanate from the genre he helped to create and maintain.  For me, a lifelong Poco and country-rock fan, the highlights include Richie's takes on John Denver's Take Me Home, Country Roads, Lonesome Town (the classic Ricky Nelson hit), and Marc Cohn's Walking in Memphis.

5.0,Five limes and coconuts for Harry's Gold,"The late, great Harry Nilsson.  Fantastic songwriter, incredible singer, true music biz outsider, master wit and humorist.  This is a great three-disc set, mostly chronologically arranged, and an excellent vehicle to celebrate the great man's career or to introduce a newbie to the Nilsson oeuvre.  Oddly enough, his biggest singles hits were covers -- of Freddie Neil's Everybody's Talkin' and Badfinger's Without You.  And some of his best-known compositions were hits for others -- Three Dog Night's One, Blood, Sweat & Tears' Without Her, the Monkees' Cuddly Toy.  Strange career moves, I suppose.  That's as may be, but they were Harry's moves, and his fans still love him for them.  The big ones are here (Coconut, Spaceman, Me & My Arrow, Best Friend, I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City, Jump into the Fire, Remember (Christmas), As Time Goes By, in addition to those mentioned above), as well as many very good to great album deep cuts.  A nice booklet of photos and liner notes would've made it all the better, but at this bargain price, well, that's merely quibbling.

4.0,"Post-Manassas, Stills is struggling to find his groove","Post-Manassas, Stephen Stills appears to have been struggling to find, or redefine, himself.  These three '70s Columbia LPs, Stills (1975), Illegal Stills (1976), Thoroughfare Gap (1978), are generally written off by critics, but they're really the work of an artist desperate to reclaim his reputation.  Disc One pairs-off both Stills and Illegal Stills, and to good effect.  Stills has always been my favorite of the three, as it contains several of his strongest songwriting efforts (Turn Back the Pages, My Favorite Changes, First Things First, As I Come of Age).  Illegal Stills fares less well, but still has plenty of highlights to recommend it (Buyin' Time, Midnight in Paris, Stateline Blues, and a smokin' cover of Neil Young's The Loner).  And then there's Disc Two, Thoroughfare Gap alone and all by itself, quite possibly the weakest Stills solo album up to this time.  The title track is truly great and belongs somewhere else.  The best of the rest are covers (Gregg Allman's Midnight Rider, Buddy Holly's Not Fade Away).  The sound is very good throughout; the packaging is up to BGO's usual high-quality standard; the liner notes are well-written and informative.

Totally killed the idea of taking the LP seriously (which was actually fairly good despite being mired in '80s-style production cliches).  It also served to damage the trio's artistic reputation in a big way -- with critics and fans.  There are strong moments (Haven't We Lost Enough, Got to Keep Open), middling moments (Live It Up, After the Dolphin), and head-scratching weak moments (Tomboy, If Anybody Had a Heart).  It all adds up to three-and-one-half stars from me.  The carry-over effect was that their next release, After the Storm, while a stronger collection of songs, was an even bigger sales failure bomb.  Atlantic lost interest and good ol' Uncle Neil bailed them out by joining them for Looking Forward, released on Reprise.  The quartet album didn't exactly set sales records either, but it did restore a certain air of respectability to CSN.",[],B000002IPM,B000002IPM,AE7BV6IMNPZ3F266H7PXMH3BZQNQ,2022-07-17 03:11:21.731,0,False,"Delicious, healthy  regional and restaurant Indian dishes in a flash!"
3.0,"Chicago, born for this moment, or living off past glories?","You've got to tip your hat to them just for their sheer perseverance if nothing else.  Chicago's Born for This Moment (Chicago XXXVIII) lives as much in the past as it does the present, and while it's not a bad album, it certainly pales in the shadow of the original band's mighty '70s work.  What has become a revolving door membership is led by three original members -- Robert Lamm, James Pankow, Lee Loughnane -- who appear to have basically turned over the reins to producer Joe Thomas and new lead (read Peter Cetera-like) singer, Neil Donell, both of whom are all over the record.  The trademark horns are dominant again, as are the group vocals, while the solid songcraft is mostly a throwback to the band's self-contained days.

3.0,Chicago at their '80s commercial peak,"A big record in the day, Chicago 19 marked the end of their second platinum era.  With the exception of Chicago Greatest Hits, 1982-1989, their Warner / Reprise hit years had hit the skids.  The hits were still coming on this collection, but they were mostly power ballads delivered by outside writers.  And the production was very '80s and non-horns.  I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love.  Look Away.  You're Not Alone.  We Can Last Forever.  What Kind of Man Would I Be?  Big sellers.  Big radio hits.  Big ballads.  But they all had a sense of 'haven't we all been here before?' about them.  And that downbeat sense would bring along the oncoming downturn in record sales and airplay for the studio follow-up, Chicago Twenty-one (a must to avoid).

It was so impressive that it sent me back to purchase CTA, their first double-album and original band name (Chicago Transit Authority).  All these decades later, here comes this full live in-concert version of Chicago's 1970 breakthrough double-album, except it's not, really.  Band membership makes the difference in this type of 'remembering a classic' situation, doesn't it?  This is through-the-turnstile, new millennium Chicago, the band of a thousand members and ex-members.  So, the music is there and so are Robert Lamm, James Pankow, and Lee Loughnane, along with a cast of hired-gun players.  But where's the heart and soul and deep musical connection?  MIA, sadly.

3.0,Yet another Chicago live retrospective,"The remains of what was once a proud and incredibly inventive '70s horn band (and an '80s power ballad hit machine), along with a revolving door cast of replacement musicians, delivers the big hits live and in-concert one more time.  This band has never really gotten over the untimely death of Terry Kath (the heart and soul of the group), nor the defection of hitmaking singer/songwriter/bassist Peter Cetera for a solo career.  Not to mention the firing of founding member/drummer Danny Seraphine and the fact that Robert Lamm tends to save his most interesting compositions for his own solo efforts.  So, here we go, one more time, into the way-back machine to a better Chicago time of hit singles, huge radio support, and fans who are hungry for more of the same.

Maybe with everything that's going on in Ukraine and in our own radically politically divided nation my thoughts just drifted in that direction.  Whatever.  Neil Young's Living with War was pure mind cheese, musically, lyrically and politically.  Deja Vu Live simply adds CSN's political dross and musical gloss to those proceedings and has nothing whatever to do with Deja Vu, the group's legendary 1970 LP.  I wish I'd given this one a pass.

Otherwise, it's all pretty forgettable filler material, and filled to the brim with an obnoxious air of self-import at that.

Atlantic Records execs refused the duo concept and demanded a trio LP (for boosted sales purposes) and so, allies on vinyl if not in arms.  The live album is very nice, but hardly essential, except for the pair of solid studio tracks that open the set, War Games and Raise a Voice.  Leftovers from the Atlantic-refused Stills - Nash project, I believe.  Concert wise, Stills kicks it up a few notches on both Turn Your Back on Love and Dark Star, the trio delivers a lovely cover of the Beatles' Blackbird, Crosby's best moment is also a cover (Joni Mitchell's For Free) but from an earlier tour, and Nash contributes a solid version of his own then-recent hit Wasted on the Way.  All in all, Allies is a curious amalgam of studio, live, and past tour recordings.  I replaced my lost LP with a Japanese CD version several years ago, and I'm very happy with it -- great sound.

It's never been clearly explained as far as I can tell, but it was obviously not a happy parting of the ways.  This was the band's first LP, post-exit, and the front cover design is that of a snake shedding its skin.  Anything to do with Cetera?  Anyway, things aren't pretty.  Jason Scheff seems lightweight and tentative as Peter's replacement, Robert Lamm appears to have retreated into the shadows, and Bill (Mr. BLOOZE) Champlin over-sings anything and everything that comes his way.  The record's first single, an inexplicable remake of 25 or 6 to 4, bombed and threatened to take the album with it.  Will You Still Love Me?  That one saved the day but pretty much locked the band into its seemingly permanent power ballad phase.  Producer David Foster plays down the group's vaunted horn section and utilizes a lot of outside-the-band songwriters for material.  Like I said, it ain't pretty.  Two-and-one-half horns.

Disc Two is a Various Artists collection that spotlights the magnificent, justifiably lauded Gerry Goffin / Carole King songwriting team.  Both discs are amazing collections.  The breadth of artists and styles on the second disc gives a solid indication of just how powerful a team Goffin / King truly was.

Yet they kept rocking on:  Just Like Me, Kicks, Hungry, Steppin' Stone (pre-Monkees), Good Thing, Him or Me - What's It Gonna Be, Too Much Talk, Let Me!  They're all smokin' and they're all included here, along with their last and biggest hit, Indian Reservation.  Their recordings were used to great effect recently in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.  Maybe that caught your attention and made you Raiders curious.  Whatever.

Following on the heels of the fantastic Feel Flows box set though, there's a certain bump in the road here.  The trouble is the programming; it's just so random.  Spanning the Boys' 60-year-career, it would have made a lot more sense (to me, anyway) to program the sets in chronological order according to release, whether by each individual disc or start-to-finish across all three discs.

Produced by Glyn Johns, I remember having high expectations when I purchased the album the week it came out in 1994.  But I was quite bewildered once I'd played it though a couple of times.  Why and when did the great CSN become such an utterly bland band of brothers?  Nearly three decades on, it hasn't improved with the passing of time.  While there are solid moments, mostly from Crosby (Camera, Till It Shines, Street to Lean On), it's a by-the-numbers album that could've been recorded by anyone.  Unequal Love, Mr. Nash?

But here they are again, finally, and CSN are not only working together, but making it work.  There's a Cali soft rock feel permeating much of the album, and that's not necessarily meant as a knock.  The lead vocals and harmonies are as evocative as ever, Stills' guitar work continues to impress, and the quality of songcraft is almost uniformly very good to excellent.  Nash delivers a pair of stone classics in Just a Song Before I Go and Cathedral, Crosby's up to the challenge with Shadow Captain and In My Dreams, and Stills hangs tough with Dark Star and I Give You Give Blind.

I just listened to it again very recently, and as it turns out, I still feel it ranks among the best of the CSN-related studio album sidebar efforts.  David Crosby and Graham Nash are both still near the top of their songwriting game, and their vocals are as on-the-money as ever.  The backing band is consistently in the pocket.  I was given a copy of the 12-track single disc version (Highlights, 2006) as a gift and was impressed enough to go back and buy the original two-cd set.

This collection pairs From Elvis Presley Boulevard (1976) and Moody Blue (1977) on one disc.  With the exception of a handful of live in-concert tracks, it all adds up to an album filled with songs of loneliness, lost love, and regret.  Three of the studio cuts rock, all in a different vein:  For the Heart has a country-rock bounce, Moody Blue displays a mild disco feel bubbling beneath its pop-rock melody, Way Down harks back to his Burning Love '70s singles heyday.  The rest is made up largely of tears-in-my-beer balladry.  Both of the discs combined here come from the 1976 Graceland sessions and feature a ton of overdubs and sweetening via Felton Jarvis, Elvis' personal producer.  How you feel about that is strictly up to you.  The sweetening was done with the full knowledge and approval of Elvis, so there you are.  The stripped-down versions found on the Way Down in the Jungle Room double-disc Legacy release sound stronger to my ears.

The material that makes up ""Manassas Pieces,"" fleshed out of course, would've made a more cohesive --and impressive -- second album.  Blowing this project off in favor of ""Down the Road"" is just one of the many bad decisions in Stephen Stills' wildly erratic career.

Great, unbelievably catchy, ear candy single (""I told her she was young and bright, and definitely out of sight, but she said 'No.'  Now that's a helluva thing to say; she just said 'no' ...) was definitely the highlight and could've been a much bigger radio hit with a bit of a push from their label.

It rocks, if a bit softly, in a kind of Adult Contemporary pop radio way.  With some of the material he appears to be shooting for Classic Rock radio acceptance (this is from the late mid-'70s, remember).  Regardless, the songcraft is there, along with those soulful Felix Cavaliere vocal leads and his amazing Hammond B-3 flourishes that up the ante on anything he records.  As is mentioned in numerous reviews, then ascending guitarist Vinnie Vincent (Cusano) leaves his mark all over the record.  Especially like the title track and I Wanna Love You (single and album versions).  I gave a copy of the CD reissue to one of my oldest and dearest friends, a lifelong Rascals fan just like me, and he thinks it's Felix's most Rascals-like post-band effort.

One of Felix's best and most successful solo projects.  The lovely Only a Lonely Heart Sees was a Top 40 hit for him, and it went all the way to number two in Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart.  Sizable hit, yes?  Then there was a change at the top of Columbia / Epic, and the new regime didn't consider Felix much of a priority.  The follow-up single, the very catchy Good to Have Love Back, barely charted due to lack of promotion, and the album sank without notice.  In my world, however, the second single would've been the Cavaliere / Eddie Brigati songwriting reunion Love Is the First Day of Spring, as Rascal-y a bit of pure pop nirvana as you could hope for.  Heck, it even features Eddie on beautiful backing vocals.  Shoulda, coulda, woulda been a smash!  Another standout track is a rockin' rearranged version of the Rascals' biggest hit single, the powerfully moving People Got to Be Free.  The lilting title track (Castles in the Air) is another beauty.  All in all, if the fates had been kinder and the stars aligned, this would've been a very big album back in the day (1980-81).

There was also the Live in Europe release, but that was CCR trio style, the band minus Tom Fogerty.  Still, a rockin' good time for hardcore Creedence fans.  CCR at Woodstock followed after decades of John Fogerty saying it wasn't a worthy enough show for record release.  Turns out it was actually excellent.  Now, here we are at The Royal Albert Hall, and it all seems rather anticlimactic, sadly.  The setlist is pretty much in line with The Concert disc (Oakland), and not much different than the trio record or the Woodstock show.  The refurbished sound is excellent (thank you, Giles Martin), the band is in its usual fine form from the day, and the British audience appears to be really into the performance.

3.0,"Chicago, Mach Three's Biggest Hit Singles","A very different Chicago than the one from the Terry Kath years.  That was a time of optimism, excitement, and experimentation, as well as immense commercial success.  The Columbia era Chicago's Greatest Hits sets (Volumes 1 and 2) were five-star compilations made up of hit singles and solid deep cuts.  Granted, Volume One is the wall-to-wall-hits one to get, while Volume Two is more of a big hits, minor hits, album deep cuts kind of contractual obligation retrospective -- but very good, nonetheless.  This collection (1982-89), on the other hand, comes from the comeback (16) and Peter Cetera-dominated video years (17), followed by the Jason Schiff / Bill Champlin power ballad era (18, 19).  Big hits, yes, on radio, MTV, and in record stores (remember them?).  Thing is, the excitement is long gone, the vaunted Chicago creativity (and masterful songwriting) is on hold, and where are those legendary horns?  It all boils down to about half a fine album (I've always had a soft spot for Hard to Say I'm Sorry / Get Away, Love Me Tomorrow, Stay the Night, and Along Comes a Woman), the rest ultimately overwhelmed by the sheer number and sameness of the mediocre ballads included (If She Would Have Been Faithful and We Can Last Forever among the absolute worst).

However, most of them balked at the price, despite admitting that it's an amazing retrospective on an underappreciated, truly talented artist.  Now, I can start bugging them about this double-disc, definitely affordable, highlights version.  It presents her as a restless talent, one who refused to be typecast by her first hit single and masterwork, Ode to Billy Joe.  She painted her LPs with a wide brush, and in a wide array of colors and styles: Originals, covers, duets, country, folk, pop, swamp rock, R&B.  Her range seemed to be unlimited.  Ms. Gentry walked away from her very successful career in 1981, when she was just 39 years old, and has chosen to remain under the celebrity radar ever sense.  Amazing talent.  Amazing story.

5.0,"The Beatles' Revolver:  Still revolving, still evolving","Along with Rubber Soul, Revolver is my favorite Beatles album.  I know I'm in the minority, as Sgt. Pepper's holds that slot in most fan's hearts.  Oh, well.  My great nephew recently asked me why the peace-loving Beatles named this album after a gun.  Had to explain to him that the revolver was the LP on the record player revolving around and delivering the music.  Nothing to do with pistols or pistoleros!  He was genuinely happy to hear that.  If anyone doubted the wisdom in the Boys' decision to give up touring in order to concentrate on studio work, Revolver set their minds to rest.  In its time and right to this very moment it is a mind-blowingly great piece of work.  Artistic in the extreme, and in a good way.<br />Stretched the boundaries.  Used the recording studio as an important part of the instrumentation.  Broke new ground musically and lyrically.  This double-disc reissue sets a new standard for an already timeless classic.  I grew up with the Capitol Records release in America and, edited down or not, it was an amazing musical statement.  The fact that Capitol had squeezed a third LP (Yesterday and Today) out of previous Beatles singles and off tracks from other LPs is all the more amazing in that it somehow worked ... against all odds.  The original British Rubber Soul and Revolver are even stronger than their shortened American counterparts, which just doesn't seem possible, but it's true.  The Revolver Special Edition?  Great remix.  Great sound.  Great packaging.  Great bonus material.  As ever and always, a Beatles project is done up right!

3.0,Bruce Springsteen's bar band soul album,"Musical heroes die hard because they're such a personal thing.  I cut my teeth on Elvis Presley recordings.  Elvis could sing anything -- pop, rock, R&B, folk, country, soulful ballads -- and he delivered them all with sincerity and genuine feeling.  Not a songwriter, however; it was his Achilles heel.  The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen.  I still listen to them all.  The Beatles incredibly talented, creative and innovative; The Beach Boys driven by Brian Wilson's musical and vocal arranging genius; Bob Dylan, the original word master and a world-shaking songwriting talent, and Bruce Springsteen, a great songwriter who reflects all that went before and then puts his own individual spin on it all.  He writes for his own voice.  The occasional in-concert (Detroit Medley, anyone?) or tribute album cover (Viva Las Vegas comes to mind) is always a moment of pure joy.  However, an entire album of covers -- putting himself in the position, as a lead singer, to be compared to the likes of Jerry Butler, Levi Stubbs, Scott Walker, David and Jimmy Ruffin, among many other vocal titans -- well, it can only be described as a no-win situation.  Bruce is Bruce, rocker and songwriter, not Elvis, master lead vocal chameleon.  Here (without the E Street Band, btw), he comes across as just another Michael McDonald, Rod Stewart erstwhile soul man, only one with impeccable taste.  Coming up on a half-century since his groundbreaking Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ and The Wild, The Innocent and the E Street Shuffle LPs, Only the Strong Survive makes a certain longevity statement, but it also reminds us of what a long, long road it's been.

5.0,The Beach Boys 1972: Still sailing on despite the odds,"An absolutely fabulous package and a more than worthy follow-up to the Feel Flows box-set.  The Jack Rieley / Blondie Chaplin - Ricky Fataar years rank among my favorites in the Beach Boys storied career.  Manager (and sometime lyricist) Rieley had guided the band back to significance with 1971's Surf's Up, a personal favorite, and 1972's Carl and the Passions - ""So Tough"" took the revamp even further.  The Flame's rhythm section, Chaplin and Fataar, not only boosted the soul content, but delivered a pair of solid songwriters to the band.  Originally packaged as a specially priced two-fer with Pet Sounds, the LP suffered in comparison with its beloved 1966 companion.  I'll admit I was baffled by the pairing at first, but over the years I've come around and grown to love ""So Tough.""  Holland (1973) has been a favorite since I first sliced through the shrink wrap on the original LP and has remained so ever since.  The great double-album Beach Boys in Concert (1973) was the final Rieley-Chaplin-Fataar Beach Boys era release (excepting 1975's Good Vibrations - Best of the Beach Boys) and it has stood up extremely well.  The amazing success of Capitol's 1974 Endless Summer two-LP set, released in a wave of sixties nostalgia in the wake of American Graffiti, spelled the end of this creative chapter in the Beach Boys saga.  Their shows shifted to car and surf oldies nights, the Brian is Back campaign resulted in less than stellar efforts like 15 Big Ones, and without the sure and certain hand of Jack Rieley at the helm the band devolved into internal warring factions.  Still, as this glorious collection attests, there were mighty, mighty artistic highs  before the inevitable fall to creative lows.  Six discs of Beach Boys nirvana may well be a bit over the top for casual fans.  For them, I'd suggest sticking to the two-disc distillation of this massive set.  For the hardcore fan, however, this beautifully presented, thoughtfully programmed, and fabulously remixed and remastered set will be the true, lasting treasure of a magnificent time in the history of one of America's greatest bands.

4.0,"Sail On Sailor, mini version","Two-disc distillation of the six-disc set.  A bit disappointing in that it only includes a handful of Carnegie Hall concert performances, whereas the boxset includes the two-set 1972 performance in full.  Still, what is included is pretty amazing.  From the Beach Boys most creative period (imho), Carl and the Passions - ""So Tough"" and Holland represent the band's last best musical efforts before its inevitable shift to oldies touring act.  And the material has never sounded better.  Holland gets the edge in my book, although I'm still a bit dubious about Mount Vernon and Fairway (A Fairytale).  To my taste, ""So Tough"" has grown stronger with the passage of time, although I've always loved You Need a Mess of Help to Stand Alone and Marcella (the great lost Beach Boys hit single of that era).  Go for the big box if you're a longtime, diehard fan; otherwise, this double-disc set will suffice.

4.0,"Rick in transition, not knowing what's directly ahead","Two fine early '60s LPs by Rick Nelson paired together on this impressive two-fer CD.  There seems to be a trend toward middle-of-the-road acceptance in the choice of material.  Rick, or more likely his management (read: Ozzie Nelson), appears to be shifting away from ""teen music"" and looking for adult / easy listening airplay.  Fine for what it is, but it came at the wrong time -- The Beatles-led British Invasion of American airwaves was just up around the bend.  The second LP is the better of the two, as it features mostly stronger material and a pair of solid hits in For You and Fools Rush In (later covered by Elvis in 1971 with the same arrangement and James Burton again on lead guitar).  There's also a beautiful, understated ballad, I Rise, I Fall, that would've made a fine third single.  Excellent notes, excellent sound, excellent vocals and production.

4.0,"Despite hit singles, Rick Nelson was cast adrift by the British Invasion in 1964","The British Invasion was just around the bend in 1963 when Rick Nelson delivered his first two albums for Decca in 1963.  Both of them (For Your Sweet Love, Rick Nelson Sings ""For You"") made the top 20 and spent about five months each in the Billboard album charts.  Decca, which had just signed Rick to a 20-year-deal (unheard of at the time, or even today for that matter!), must have seen nothing but blue skies, high tides, and green grass on the horizon for their new golden boy.  ""For You"" carried Rick into 1964 on a high, both the single (peaking at #6) and the LP (which went to #14).  And then, man overboard!  The Brits blew Rick's career out of the water.  The Very Thought of You, which took a For You / Fools Rush In updated pop arrangement approach to this classic, fought its way to #26 in the Billboard singles chart in the spring of '64, but only lingered in the chart for less than two months.  The LP of the same title was delayed for release until late summer and never charted at all.  Spotlight on Rick, his second 1964 album release, had a hopeful but ultimately ironic title in that the commercial spotlight was anywhere but ""on Rick.""  Rick had been cast adrift.  Despite their commercial failure, both LPs actually have a lot to like about them.  The Very Thought of You continues in the mildly rocking, easy listening groove of ""Sings for You,"" while ""Spotlight"" rocks a bit more and contains Elvis buddy and longtime Memphis Mafia member Red West's ""I'm a Fool,"" later a hit single for Dino, Desi & Billy, former Elvis girlfriend Dottie Harmony's sweet ""In My Dreams,"" and frequent Elvis songwriting contributor Joy Byers' (actually producer Bob Johnston) ""Stop, Look and Listen,"" covered in an organ-based arrangement by Elvis for his ""Spinout!"" soundtrack.  1964 had begun promisingly for Rick and his amazing Decca deal, but ended with a dull thud, commercially.  He wouldn't see the light of day on the LP charts again until 1970, with the great ""Rick Nelson in Concert.""  But he just kept on plugging and never gave up.  The sign of a true winner.

4.0,"Rudderless Rick in post-British Invasion America, 1965","Like so many other American pop stars, Rick Nelson was blown out of the water by the Beatles-led British Invasion of American record shops and radio airwaves in 1964.  In 1965, the same acts were further trampled underfoot by the rise of folk-rock.  Meanwhile, Rick was wrapping up his The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet series while preparing for a renewed stab at movie stardom with Love and Kisses.  His recently attained 20-year contract was beginning to cause a certain panic in the Decca Records executive offices.  When the deal kicked off in 1963, Rick delivered a trio of hit singles and a pair of top 20 albums for the label.  Things took a dive following the success Fools Rush In and For You in '64, and his career hit its nadir in '65.  Two bomb LPs that never charted (the two paired here, Best Always and Love and Kisses) and only one single that even cracked Billboard's Top 100.  As for the Love and Kisses movie, well, it was strictly bomb's away!  John Stafford's liner notes compare the 1965 careers of Rick and Elvis Presley, but not to its year end conclusion.  ""Instantly forgettable"" is the term he uses for Presley's three feature films -- Girl Happy, Tickle Me, and Harum Scarum.  Many people would agree with that assessment.  However, he doesn't take into account Elvis' large and loyal fanbase: All three films were financially successful; they scored Elvis four more top 20 singles and a pair of top 10 LPs (Tickle Me had no soundtrack LP album release), and they continue to play to audiences on television and disc all these decades later.  As for these two Rick Nelson LPs, he sounds as lost in the studio as he was in the charts of the day.  On Best Always, he sounds callow and unsure covering classics like You Don't Know Me, Since I Fell for You, and My Blue Heaven.  The best of the bunch are Billy Vera's Mean Old World and future singer/songwriter duo Seals and Crofts' Only the Young and When the Chips Are Down.  As for Love and Kisses, he takes a nice, comfortable, Fools Rush In approach to More, the album's highlight, along with Red West's Love Is Where You Find It, Roger Miller's I Catch Myself Crying, and the Addrisi  Brothers' I Paid for Loving You.  His reading of The Fantasticks' Try to Remember, however, is shallow and without emotional weight.  But better days were coming just up the line in the form of two country LPs that would eventually lead Rick to country-rock and the formation of the Stone Canyon Band.  This two-fer?

5.0,Elvis '72:  Another 'Lost' Album,"Another in a long list of bungled Elvis albums.  Like The Lost Album of 1963, Burning Love (or as it was originally advertised in 1972, Standing Room Only) is finally seeing the light of day.  The Standing Room Only project was retitled Elvis on Tour (along with the well-known tour documentary) and was penciled in as a kind of follow-up to 1970's Elvis: That's the Way It Is documentary ""soundtrack.""  A mix of studio tracks and live cuts, That's the Way It Is had been a big success on film and disc, and MGM, RCA, and the Elvis camp were looking to repeat the formula.  Then, along came the Madison Square Garden concert.  The SRO cover was scrapped and reassigned to the Garden live LP, which was not only a huge success but had legs in the charts.  The SRO singles (Burning Love and Separate Ways) had raced up the charts and Colonel Sanders' eyes lit up.  Perfect time for one of his lucrative RCA side deals:  We'll just dump the SRO LP completely, slap together a pair of RCA Camden cheapies featuring the recent A- and B-sides and laugh at Elvis' sinking artistic reputation all the way to the bank, or gambling tables, or wherever.  Cynical and somewhere beyond sad.  As this collection proves, Elvis the recording artist was denied yet another moment in the sun.  The album as originally conceived would've been warmly received, even embraced, across the board.  Instead, the Burning Love and Separate Ways LPs were mocked by critics, ignored by the general record buying public, and gobbled up by the hardcore fans.  Despite the passage of so many decades (half-century?), this release goes a long way in rectifying the situation.

5.0,The 1966 / 1968 foundations of two more 'lost' Elvis LPs,"Just who was sleeping at the wheel at RCA back in the mid- to late-sixties?  At least in the case of Elvis Presley's recording career, I think they were just sick and tired and worn-out from dealing with his manager, Colonel Tom Parker.  Movies ruled in Parker's world, so Elvis' recording career was on the back burner.  Or was it?  Elvis continued to do non-film recording sessions at RCA's Studio B in Nashville, often with thrilling results.  Instead of issuing cohesive LPs from the sessions, however, Parker scattered the tracks over singles A- and B-sides, soundtrack album 'bonus ' songs, and budget LP filler.  Where the heck was RCA's A&R advisors?  For diehard Elvis fans like yours truly, this was an ongoing bone of contention for years.  Years when LPs had become much more prominent and important in the post-Beatles sixties.  This 18-track compilation presents, in essence, a double-dip of what might have been: Superior material that would have been the basis of two more solid Elvis albums in 1966 and 1968.  The Grammy winning How Great Thou Art was the non-soundtrack studio LP of 1967.  Love Letters, Down in the Alley, I'll Remember You, Guitar Man, Big Boss Man, You Don't Know Me, and the magnificent Dylan cover title song are among the highlights but, in truth, there's not a bad track to be found here.

4.0,Rick's successful country-rock journey continues,"Following up on the well-received country experiments of Bright Lights & Country Music (1966) and Country Fever (1967), RIck Nelson basically misfired with a pair of contemporary pop/rock LPs, Another Side of Rick (1967) and Perspective (1968).  Both failed critically and commercially, so it was back to the country-based drawing board.  Rick formed the basis of the Stone Canyon Band and issued a cover of Bob Dylan's She Belongs to Me in a country-rock arrangement that gave him his first Top 40 hit in five years, followed that up with the very well-received Rick Nelson in Concert LP (1969), from which Decca culled  another Top 50 single with Rick's own Easy to Be Free.  Based on that success came the gutsy move called Rick Sings Nelson (1970) and its follow-up, Rudy the Fifth (1971).  Rick Sings Nelson was bold in that Nelson, basically an inexperienced songwriter, wrote the entire LP's material.  And it's surprisingly good, if not exactly great.  It has a solid band vibe, and one could feel Nelson's own sense of satisfaction and joy in his new group's growth.  It didn't exactly set the charts on fire but garnered mostly positive reviews in its day.  It also holds up pretty well.  A blend of originals and covers, Rudy the Fifth didn't fare as well as its immediate predecessors, but it had its own special impact on Rick and the band.  Rudy was the LP the boys were touring when they appeared as the headline act on one of Richard Nader's Rock 'n' Roll Oldies shows at Madison Square Garden in 1972.  When they played their cover of the Rolling Stones' Honky Tonk Women from the album the audience is said to have reacted in a very negative fashion, leading Rick Nelson to eventually write Garden Party -- a songwriting career high water mark, smash hit single, and the title of his next LP.  Ahh, it's all good when you follow your muse.  For this two-fer?  Four rising stars and a definite recommendation to fans of Rick Nelson, the Stone Canyon Band, and '70s country-rockers in general.",[],B00000I535,B00000I535,AE7BV6IMNPZ3F266H7PXMH3BZQNQ,2023-01-13 23:52:54.269,0,False,A passionate whirlwind of rhythm
4.0,A pair of albums that led the way to Rick's Cali country-rock career,"Searching for a new form of artistic expression that just might lift him out of his post-Beatles commercial doldrums, Rick Nelson took his longtime guitarist James Burton's advice and recorded a country album in 1966.  For Rick, it was actually a kind of back-to-basics experiment.  And it worked!  It worked so well, in fact, that he delivered a second country-based LP in 1967.  While neither album set the charts on fire, they did receive very good to excellent notices and helped to redesign his stage show.  More importantly, they pointed the way to his Cali country-rock career and the formation of the Stone Canyon Band a couple of years down the line.  Along with a raft of classic country covers (Welcome to My World, Hello Walls, Night Train to Memphis), he found his songwriting jones on 1966's ""Bright Lights"" in the form of You Just Can't Quit, a musical statement of purpose as much to himself as others.  The following year's ""Country Fever"" continued the trend, mixing in some rock-related covers (Mystery Train, Dylan's Walkin' Down the Line) among the country classics (Funny How Time Slips Away, You Win Again), and adding a pair of Nelson originals this time around (Alone, Salty Dog).  For whatever reason, he followed with another pair of pop/rock records in 1967-68 (Another Side of Rick and Perspective), both of which failed to register with any kind of audience.  So, it was on to country-rock via the Stone Canyon Band's cover of Bob Dylan's She Belongs to Me (Top 40 chart success for the first time in five years!) and a return to the top 50 on the LP charts with Rick Nelson in Concert in 1969.  Rick had finally managed to turn the page and he began a successful new stage in his career with the great Stone Canyon Band.  This country two-fer had led the way.  Four rising stars and highly recommended.",[],B000007O74,B000007O74,AE7BV6IMNPZ3F266H7PXMH3BZQNQ,2023-01-14 21:46:51.396,0,False,Gritty blend of urban desolation and otherworldly faeries
4.0,"Rick Nelson & the Stone Canyon Band's peak LPs and fadeaway, 1972/74","Garden Party was Rick Nelson's commercial peak with the Stone Canyon Band, both the LP and especially the hit single.  And while the 1972 album has its moments outside the hit 45 (I Wanna Be with You, I'm Talking About You, Don't Let Your Goodbye Stand), it is actually eclipsed by its 1974 follow-up, the luscious, largely acoustic-based Windfall.  Sadly, no hit singles on that one, therefore not the big hit LP it should've / could've been.  Its commercial failure actually caused MCA (originally Decca Records) to negate their 20-year-deal with Rick with nine years left on the contract.  Sad, really, as it signaled the end of the mighty Stone Canyon Band and put Rick's career in a truly downward spiral from which it would never really recover.  Regardless, the largely forgotten Windfall album is the real reason to purchase this fine two-fer disc.  Still a blossoming songwriter, Rick Nelson contributed three solid compositions to the LP (Someone to Love, Lifestream, Windfall), with his bandmates also delivering the goods (Legacy, How Many Times, Don't Leave Me Here).  He and the group also deliver a sterling cover of Baker Knight's I Don't Want to Be Lonely Tonight (NOT the James Taylor song).  With Garden Party the band finally hit the top, and with Windfall, they went out on a grace note after five years of country-rock adventures.  Four fading stars and highly recommended to fans of Rick Nelson, the Stone Canyon Band, and California country-rock.",[],B00000AOSO,B00000AOSO,AE7BV6IMNPZ3F266H7PXMH3BZQNQ,2023-01-15 23:07:13.347,0,False,"A fun, sassy read"
5.0,"Time Out of Mind ... One more time, and then some","One of the absolute best in Dylan's Bootleg Series releases.  One of my all-time favorite albums remixed to a different level of clarity - it doesn't sound better, just different -- while maintaining its artistic stature and mythical standing in the Dylan canon.  I've always loved the original Daniel Lanois production, for sure, and as I've said the remix is neither better nor worse, but it has a certain audio clarity not found in the original release.  It's less moody, maybe that's the best way to describe it.  In addition, you get out-takes, first takes, previously unreleased tracks, a disc of live versions, and the bonus disc material comes from the hard-to-locate Tell Tale Signs (Bootleg Series, Volume 8).  These recordings revived Bob Dylan's career when it was near its lowest commercial ebb, yes, but personally, Time Out of Mind helped me get through some of the toughest times of my life.  And for that, I'm eternally grateful.  If you're a longtime, hardcore fan of Mr. Dylan, as I certainly am, you're sure to find a lot to love in Fragments.  Five glowing stars and highly recommended.  ** 3/7/2023.  If the cost concerns you, the two-disc version is leaner but hardly thinner.  Same great material, an excellent sampler of the box and also highly recommended.",[],B0BKR6V1ZV,B0BKR6V1ZV,AE7BV6IMNPZ3F266H7PXMH3BZQNQ,2023-01-29 01:11:47.740,0,True,Haunting and evocative
5.0,Musical Nirvana for the diehard '70s Elvis fan,"Elvis in concert in the '70s.  Always a bone of contention among fans, probably because -- like the '60s film years -- it was allowed to go on too long and Elvis found himself in another artistic rut.  Happily, the downturn had yet to really take hold at the time of Elvis On Tour.  He was still involved and committed and enjoying it all in 1972, and fans -- both newbies and long term -- were the better for it all.  This collection's highlights include three previously unreleased full shows as well as a remixed concert, rehearsals, and behind the curtain RCA Studio C, Hollywood tracks, plus the BluRay version of the original film release.  A visit to Elvis Nirvana for Elvis diehards.  What would've made it all the better, for me anyway, would have been the reconstruction of the Standing Room Only (original, discarded title) soundtrack album.  That proposed 1972 LP was sacrificed in favor of the Madison Square Garden album (which actually even copped its cover photo!).  Thus, the singles Burning Love b/w It's a Matter of Time and Separate Ways b/w Always on My Mind were relegated to budget Camden releases, and An American Trilogy b/w The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face remained homeless.  Thus far it's only ever been available as an overly expensive Follow That Dream import release.  Including it here would've been the perfect -- though decades late -- salute to early '70s Elvis and his fans.  Still, as is, On Tour is worthy of five golden scarves and I highly recommend it.",[],B0B88XSYRM,B0B88XSYRM,AE7BV6IMNPZ3F266H7PXMH3BZQNQ,2023-01-29 01:48:00.303,1,True,Sparse but haunting

5.0,Elvis: Rhythm & Country.  Essential?  Absolutely!,"The fifth entry in RCA's Essential Elvis series, Rhythm and Country centers on Elvis' post-Aloha from Hawaii Stax Studios Memphis sessions in 1973.  Three spotty LPs resulted from these sessions: Raised on Rock, Good Times, and Promised Land.  Unfortunate.  Handled with more care and a bit of artistic vision, the session's resulting material could have been presented (and remembered) in a much more favorable light.  A pop album.  A country album.  A then-modern R&B album.  As usual at that time, however, Elvis was not a top artistic priority at RCA; he was more of a low-budget way to print money.  Songs thrown together without any kind of rhyme or reason, delivered in cheesy packages that had nothing to do with the music inside the interchangeable (often out-of-focus) live-in-concert photo covers.  By 1973, they had already begun to resemble the RCA Camden budget releases that came out with alarming frequency to glut the market with ""Elvis product"" (which lined the Colonel's pockets as side deals with the record company).  Anyway, Rhythm & Country's 'alternate versions' program goes a long way toward correcting and elevating a much-misunderstood period in the Great Man's recording history.  The 18-song playlist does indeed mix rhythm and country songs -- along with a touch of Gospel and a healthy dose of pop radio material -- into a tasty gumbo of the wide span of American music Elvis embraced.  And it's done with sure-handed care and logic.  The accompanying booklet features excellent notes, along with photos and memorabilia from the era.  As Elvis famously replied when asked what kind of singer he was, ""I sing all kinds.""  He sure did and, Lord almighty, he sent our temperature's rising!

5.0,Ex-GI Elvis tearing it up at Studio B,"Post army Elvis sessions at RCA's Studio B in Nashville, from 1960 through 1964.  Alternate takes (with the exception of the magnificent title track), studio chatter, and the sheer joy of making music abound.  And just by listening in, you get the feeling you're there and witnessing something great being created.  Elvis is in the moment, every moment, and these sessions (from 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963 and 1964) are pure magic -- as well as a much-needed respite for the 25- to 29-year-old King from the drudgery of his endless (and steadily deteriorating in artistic quality) movie soundtrack sessions.  It is a total joy to listen in on the interplay between and Elvis and the Nashville A Team; they're not only having a ton of fun creating music together, but they show an unmistakable respect toward one another.  Such a Night has been around for a while and may even be out-of-print, but if you're an Elvis fan and can locate a reasonably priced used copy, DO IT!  You won't be disappointed.

5.0,The best of the Elvis' Golden Records series,"Expanded version of an album I was given for my 13th birthday, all those years ago.  Covering Elvis' early Sixties post-Army singles, it has remained my favorite in the five-deep Elvis' Golden Records series and a staple in my record / CD collection.  Expanded for CD with the originals of hit covers, as well as well-known movie soundtrack EP and LP hits, Elvis' Golden Records Volume 3 gives a widescreen view of Elvis' amazing1960-62 singles chart career.  You get the great ballads that show off his new vocal approach to great effect (It's Now or Never, Surrender, Are You Lonesome To-Nite?), his then-new easy rockin' pop approach (Stuck on You, I Gotta Know, Good Luck Charm, She's Not You), some bluesy rockers (I Feel So Bad, Little Sister, King of the Whole Wide World), and some of his biggest movie hits (Wooden Heart, Follow That Dream, Can't Help Falling in Love).

5.0,"Fairly good tunes from now awesomely evolved  Christian Surfer Rock Group 'Switchfoot', the next Third Day, U-2","At bargain basement prices, I decided to work my way back from Switchfoot's 3 recent LP works to their earlier titles and was very pleasantly surprised, especially 'New Way 2 B Human' and 'Learning 2 Breathe.'  --> These were 95% very good to excellent, while ""Chin"" was about 50-80% good to very good, depending on how much you like Switchfoot....  That being said, let me re-iterate what I've said in my other reviews: Most people do not realize their cross-over power as of yet (e.g., witness their powerful theme song to ""Narnia:Prince Caspian""). Fact is, and it's' been written about elsewheres, truly great bands with new unique sounds can take 2-5 years to catch on, and so can their record sales and reputation, despite a [current] dedicated core following; and I truly believe that is what's [happening] going to happen w/ Switchfoot!<br />  [Truly,] they've really got something on the ball, or in their case- the surfboard!  They have a synergistic energy with a new never-before-seen-nor-heard combo of instrumentational sounds, truly talented & authentic musicians (rare these days), powerfully creative yet poetic home-run lyrics, and uniquely strong vocals -- therefore, arguably, making them the U-2, or new Audio Adrenaline (or take your pick) if you will, of Christian Rock.  So, if they keep up the flow of cover to cover super albums that include the striking lyrics, hard hitting new musical sounds, continue to probe their range (not just duplicate it), and perhaps broaden just a tad those pleasing vocals of their lead; then, all they need do is stick together, write strong original songs that keep spinning off into singles in the Christian Rock arena, get a few more cross-over hits, /ballads if not anthems, and maybe even a movie them song (wouldn't hurt, now that they've broken that ice)... then, just keep touring on & off (as the spirit moves them):  then, I sincerely believe, they could indeed become the next Third Day.  And my prayer would be that they do some real good with those kind of resources, and become Ambassadors --like Bono-- and do the Lord's work on the world scene, but down in the details.  {Because Switchfoot's lyrics and music have been a real inspiration to me thruough my illnesses, spine surgeries, and recovery & physical rehab this past 2 years.  Keep up the good work boys.  I've dusted off my keyboards once again because of groups like you and a whole host of other new Christian Rock groups out there now, and have been asked to join a local CR group... Thanx--it's all your fault!  I meant that in a good way!}<br />  Anyhoo, that's how much I think of them and can't seem to get enough of them.  If you like to rock out, you'll fall for them too; and be sure to keep them next to you Thousand Foot Krutch, P.O.D., and your RED CD's.  Those jam good n' hard.  Plus, next time you listen to them, ""I dare you to move"" to their lyrics page (web or Cd insert) -if you haven't already- and see how truly brilliant they are.  Next for me is on to 'The Early Years' when I find a great price... 'cuz I got a huge CD Collection w/ hundres of Christian Rock & Pop CD's from BMG/S&S, CBD, & Amazon, but never never pay more than $5 a CD.<br />  Rock on w/ a positive message; these tunes are doing just that at it's BEST, no lie, no joke!  Live long and prosper.  Best part for real people who appreciate music and who don't want cottom candy for Jesus, this type of Christian Rock is NOT AT ALL smarmy sugary-saccharin sickeningly sweet nor heavy handed w/ their message, and you have to listen up a bit to even kinda tell it's positive, optimistic music with a heavenly eternal spin... So, you can play it anywhere for anyone without getting into trouble, embarrassment, nor barfing anyone out.  Pretty clever, poetic, talented musicians... and not too shabby for a bunch of west coast surfer boys!  --Yours in good rock ON the rock, WT  *** P.S.

5.0,"I like their early work, and I like this.","I am kind of unusual among NP fans, in that I only recently became aware of them.  My first exposure was a short clip of &#34;High Ticket Attractions&#34; as bumper music on an AM radio station.  It caught my ear, but this was a month before &#34;Whiteout Conditions&#34; was released.  So, I bought Mass Romantic, then all their earlier stuff and binge-listened constantly for 6 weeks.  I couldn't get enough of it.  The NP's became &#34;my new favorite band&#34; and I was kicking myself for not knowing about them (I listen to hard rock mostly).  Later on, after I was fully versed with the early catalog, I finally bought &#34;Whiteout&#34;<br /><br />With that background, it is my opinion that that tracks 5-on of this album are the strongest single stretch of music among all their albums.

4.0,An old white lady's take on K'naan's work,"I try to be hip, but it's a little hard for an ""old white lady"" to be truly hip. I got Troubadour, I confess, because this hippie chick always liked reggae and I wanted to see how the musical elements were blended. My experience with Hip Hop is largely what I've heard blaring too loudly out of cars I'm stuck beside in traffic--that and the Sarah Palin SNL ""mother-lovin' moose"" skit--but those eyes rolling at me when I hurriedly roll up my window plus the knowledge that Hip Hop is sweeping the world in popularity made me want to educate myself so I'd be a little less square. (Well, that's the word we used to use for it. I have no idea what the same thing is in the current hip vernacular!)<br /><br />I have to say that I liked this CD more than I thought I would. First off, I was pleasantly surprised at how well K'naan enunciates his words. One of things I've disliked so much about rap lyrics is that I often cannot make out much more than the four-letter words; then what comes across is a bunch of anger and ugliness without much in the way of content to enlighten me and draw me in. This compilation is different. I can understand what's being said, and what's being said is often meaningful--and more broadly so--than most of the rap I've been exposed to has seemed to me. K'naan is just as adept as some infamous rappers at using those four-letter words, but they are used to good effect--not solely for their shock value or as a coded badge of entry for members of a narrowly circumscribed, exclusive little club.<br /><br />The way K'naan and his collaborators juxtapose rap rhythms with more traditional musical elements is appealing. When there is a spoken rap line, the elements backing it up are more melodic; when the vocals are sung (as on my favorite tracks), the beat is more rap-like. As for the non-rap elements, these I found most engaging. The African flavors are especially appealing, making me want to hear more. (That Paul Simon was so strongly criticized for trying to introduce African music to white Americans was an unfortunate musical setback at a time when a whole generation of Pop/Rock lovers was ready to open up to something new.)<br /><br />I personally enjoy the subtleties of Troubadour more than the up-front ""energetic"" aspects of it, although I suspect most Hip Hop fans might feel quite the opposite. I quickly tire of rap--I know a lot of my unhip friends do as well--but when used judiciously as an accent embedded in a larger mosaic of fresh sound, I find it enlivening.<br /><br />As it stands, Troubadour is not a CD I'd listen to in its entirety on a regular basis, but there are several tracks--the ones that made me get up and shake my booty in spite of myself--that I will definitely incorporate into my playlists. If K'naan can continue to evolve beyond ""just rap"" without betraying his roots, my sense is that he will be able to attract an audience far larger than the Hip Hop crowd.",[],B001L2I27O,B001L2I27O,AELARKBAP6VKNL4D22ORELHTREBA,2009-05-21 20:04:31.000,52,False,Based upon historic events!

5.0,"Nostalgic, Exciting, Sad","This is my first comeback. All of the eras represented in these three discs are still fresh to me, and because I only started listening a year ago, the group’s development as artists is obvious to me.<br /><br />I shouldn’t feel nostalgic.<br /><br />So why am I crying?<br /><br />The news that they're taking a hiatus was not that unexpected. They've devoted so much of their young adulthood to the group and to their fans, plus the pandemic has kept them on uncertain ground that it's hard to adjust to when seven have to move the same way at the same time. So, that's hard, but not why I cry.<br /><br />Gratitude, maybe? The anthology songs they chose include a solo stage and a favorite OT7 song picked by each. Their thoughtfulness aside, BTS is a group that always has a message for their listeners. It can be broadly about social justice (No More Dream) or about a specific event (Spring Day, the melody of which uses genius changes to evoke the loss of innocence and friends - and uses the simple refrain I miss you I miss you to break your heart).<br /><br />Maybe there’s a little trepidation? Yet To Come, one of the three new songs and the only one so far to have a video, is light and poppie and assures us all that there’s more. But the video heavily references not only their past music videos but also a specific performance video of Life Goes On. And forward motion is good, right? But the best moment is yet to come is a statement that asks a lot of trust of the listener. Particularly when the past is as good as theirs.<br /><br />And the kind of trust it asks for is a jumping into the void/letting go kind of trust. Especially when the passage of time affects their obligations to their home country and their physical ability to continue doing the pyrotechnic choreography that made them that much better- on top of lyricism, social accountability, and reciprocal concern for their fandom - but, yeah, the athleticism has been outstanding.<br /><br />I think that may be the answer to why I am crying. They’re clearly drawing a line between then and what’s next. If they eventually get back together to perform in concerts, it won't be what it was before.<br /><br />Musically, there’s nothing to cry about, unless it’s tears of thankfulness. Instead of just a greatest hits compilation, they’ve added three new songs and a disc full of demos. Clever men, they share with us unpolished versions of themselves while answering the bitter critics who (falsely) allege that the members do not actually write.<br /><br />So, whatever comes next, we are assured that the smack talk and clap back will continue. Plus the bop.<br /><br />Run BTS is an upbeat number with a groove that begs for choreography. For Youth references all of the sweet songs and the not so sweet ones about innocence and, to an extent, power disparities in an inherently unjust world. There is nothing about this song that suggests BTS is going to stop trying to make the world a better place.<br /><br />The record merits multiple listen. Even if you know the old songs well, hearing them in this new context will reveal more. And I dare you not to make it move left and right.<br /><br />Notes: Disc 2's OST/OT7 picks go in fan chant order. And the standard edition weighs a ton -> SO many pages in the books.

4.0,Doin it LeVert style-the early hits,"I remember in 1984 when Pop, Pop, Pop, Pop (goes my mind) was just released. LeVert wasn't widely known then so they felt comfortable parousing the halls of Randall Park Mall (North Randall, OH-a small suburb of Cleveland, OH). Remembering each other from study hall @ Shaker Heights High School, when Gerald and I spotted each other,  we both threw our hands up to recognize each other saying hello. Afterwards, the group blew up!<br /><br />My husband & I married the summer of 1986 (both hailing from Shaker Heights High School) so to support the hometown boys, we purchased all of the early LeVert hits which set many romantic moods for us. Casanova, My Forever Love & Addicted to you just to name a few. It seemed the boys couldn't strike a wrong chord. C-town was so proud of the hometown boys.<br /><br />Gerald's musical direction (in my opinion) took a different turn once he began his solo career so I didn't keep track. However, the untimley deaths of Gerald then Sean did rekindle my memories of their earlier hits which led me to purchase ""The Best of LeVert"".<br /><br />It's a cool purchase for lovers of the original LeVert style.",[],B00005A09N,B00005A09N,AEO77PF7QZ6WQOZVVUZMLVGVIW6Q,2009-01-19 23:29:44.000,4,True,Memories of his westerns interfered...

5.0,A common theme in childhood....abandonment,"Listening to Mary with her mournful and eerie sound, you get a good picture of her life.  In this case, the theme here is abandonment in this concept album.  Mary was abandoned by her mother in St. Vincent's Hospital in New Orleans; was adopted and endured the ugly childhood so many have.  She has the baggage... abandonment, search, rejection.<br /><br />But, start from the beginning with the Foundling, the mood takes one back, and trying to figure what happened in Mary's life.  Aside from the storyline, from pain to believe in love,  I really enjoyed the music here, the many instruments, accordion, slide guitar, fiddle, organ, violin.<br /><br />I can't pick a favorite, I low the flow of the music, the voice and of course the story told.

5.0,Truly... a great concert with superb bluegrass musicians!,"If you have never been a fan of bluegrass, but love gospel music, you will learn to appreciate quality bluegrass.  Bill Gaither has gathered Homecoming Friends and some great bluegrass performers for this TWO part Homecoming Concerts that is a departure from the usual.<br /><br />What makes this so special is the blending of country artists, bluegrass, and good old gospel music in a live setting with notable entertainers, Ralph Stanley, Marty Stuart, Ricky Skaggs, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Marty Raybon.  You might recognize Marty from the country group Shenandoah. And, there are more, The Isaacs, The Easters, Rhonda Vincent, Del McCoury, Doyle Lawson, and the Lewis Family and the Gaither Vocal Band singing that beautiful song ""Yes I Know"".<br /><br />You will see a great instrumental of pure bluegrass pickin with several of the performers.  And for the Bonus Feature, Marty Stuart goes back to the original home of AP Carter and sings with family members.<br /><br />The music is listed as:  This Little Light Of Mine (Marty Stuart And His Fabulous Superlatives);  Just Over in Heaven and We Shall Inherit (Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver); The Gospel Plow (The Nashville Bluegrass Band)<br /><br />Lee Highway Blues (Stuart Duncan, Marty Stuart); Yes, I Know (Gaither Vocal Band);  A Robin Built A Nest On Daddy's Grave and Gloryland  (Ralph Stanley & Clinch Mountain Boys);<br />When The Angels Sing and You Don't Love God If You Don't Love Your Neighbor (Rhonda Vincent And The Rage)<br /><br />Swing Low, Sweet Chariot (The Easters)  Halfway Home Cafe (Ricky Skaggs & Kentucky Thunder)<br />Bluegrass Breakdown (Ricky Skaggs, Marty Stuart, Del McCoury)<br /><br />Is Not This The Land Of Beulah (The Isaacs) Get Up In Jesus' Name (Marty Raybon)<br /><br />So Many Years, So Many Blessings and Honey in the Rock (The Lewis Family);  I Believe and Get Down On Your knees and Pray (Del McCoury)  Sunday Meetin' Time (Jake Hess)<br /><br />I Find Jesus and Will The Circle Be Unbroken (The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band)<br /><br />This is a great concert!!

5.0,Sweet Sweet Sweet!,"Lucinda Williams is one of those songwriters who is all about the stories in the music.  I think many people can reach out to the words she composes.  Reaching out to the darker and/or more somber side of life, the sadness, suicide, lonliness and innocence as in ""Memphis Pearl"".  And of course, the fun, upbeat like in ""Lines Around Your Eyes"".<br /><br />This CD is, for me, a more musical side of Lucinda.  At times, she can sound monotone, but I love the music background and her voice.  This CD is wonderful to just sit, relax, absorb yourself into the words, those fascinating stories.  But, as I said, I love the musical side of this CD.<br /><br />This is one CD that you can listen over and over, it is soothing, smooth, and what a voice!

5.0,As close as you can get to Don and Phil Everly;  Billie Joe could do this alone!!,"It's almost impossible to come this close to the beautiful harmonies of Don and Phil Everly, but this is beautiful.  There's something about that voice of Billie Joe Armstrong, but combine that with the soft beautiful voice of Norah Jones, is icing on the cake.<br /><br />As I listen, the voice that is more prominent is Billie Joe's.  I love his voice, and he could do this album alone and it would be amazing!!<br /><br />This album tribute is the music of The Everly Brothers, ""Songs our Father Taught Us"".  Their father, Ike Everly sang in his early career and the boys were young tikes.  But, these songs are dark and brooding. They originate from the Greatest Country Folk Music, the birth of country recordings.<br /><br />Several of these songs are included in the Franklin Mint Record Society Greatest Country Music Recordings of all Time (LPs). Gene Autry recorded ""Silver Haired Daddy of Mine"" in 1931.<br /><br />The themes are love, loss, death, and sorrow. ""I'm Here to Get My Baby Out of Jail"" is a plea from an old lady to a warden begging to let her son out.<br /><br />""Lightening Express"", a small boy boards a train with a letter in hand from his dying mother. Lacking a ticket, a stern conductor advises the boy to get off at the next stop. The boys says, ""I want to reach home and kiss mother goodbye before God takes her away.""<br /><br />""Down in the Willow Garden"" certainly dates back to the 30s/40s when sung by Charlie Monroe, brother of Bill Monroe. The tragedy involves a lass who murdered his love, Rose Connelly, and the man always believed what his father told him ""that money would set you free.""<br /><br />""Long Time Gone"" reflects on departure, tears and sorrow. This music is unique, but what makes it so pleasurable is the sweet and delicate harmony of the Everly Brothers.<br /><br />Listening to this is simply beautiful, relaxing, and such pleasantry to the ears!  I love this.  As I said, it is almost impossible to match the harmony of the Everlys, but this one is very very close.

4.0,Well Worth Owning,"Some people don't think Don Gillis compares to our best American Composers such as Copland, Thomson or Grofe.  I disagree.  All of the Gillis works are at least as interesting as those by other American Composers.  Gillis wrote light, fun music and this album is no exception.  The only other reviewer when I wrote this, didn't like the concerto, especially the last movement.  I enjoyed it almost more than the symphony and liked the last movement the best.  To each his own, I suppose.  Maybe Gillis was an imitator and that's what bothers some people.  It seems to me that imitation can be very skillful as one can imitate without sounding too much like another composer.  Gillis had his own unique sound and while these works aren't his best, there are certainly still very good.  With almost no Gillis recordings available a couple of years ago, it's wonderful to have these now.  Gillis may not have been the most original composer or even considered a top-notch composer, but his works are so enjoyable and listenable, who cares?",[],B0006SSOX6,B0006SSOX6,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,2007-03-31 04:14:46.000,7,False,"Totally unique cookbook...it's a ""must"" for the creative cook!"
5.0,One of Muldaur's Best,"For some reason I could never stand Peggy Lee; can't quite put my finger on it but perhaps it was something about her voice that irritated me.  For that reason I was a little reluctant to get this album.  My doubts were gone right from the first song.  Muldaur's treatment of these songs is superb and this is one of her best albums.  I could be considered a bit biased.  I now have 17 Muldaur albums and not a bad one in the lot; all 4 and 5 star-rated albums.  One thing I have noticed too is the quality band work that backs up Muldaur on most of her albums, including this one.

5.0,A Walk Down Memory Lane,"Many of the old stars are represented here including Pee Wee King, Rex Allen, Slim Whitman, Red Foley, Marty Robbins, Kitty Wells, Eddy Arnold, Gene Autry, Ernest Tubb, Webb Pearce and many, many others.  It's a treasury of great old country & western songs mostly from a time when the songs were just called either ""country music"" or ""western songs"" before country and western were combined as a single genre.  The quality of the recordings is quite good, even though I suspect some of these were recorded probably half a century ago or more and some were probably recorded originally in mono.  Sometimes ""historic"" recordings are full of static, muffled or noisy.  There is none of that in any of these songs; the fidelity is quite good.  While they don't sound like they were recorded yesterday, they have either been very well restored or perhaps were the best recordings of the time.  All the songs here are fun to listen to and will take you back to the 40's and 50's.  A very nice collection with nice variety.

What I didn't realize then is that he could sing really very well.  I was never a fan (at least not then) and then a few years ago heard Garden Party and Travelin' Man and I was hooked.  That's what got me to buy the album and then what a treat to discover that all the songs on this album are very good.  Some of the reviews complain that the album isn't very complete, but it has 14 songs which is more than most single albums.  It's a good value and the sound quality is good.

5.0,Delightful and Refreshing,"Before I discovered this album, I had never heard of Annette Hanshaw and I am 59 years old.  Probably anyone under 70 or 80 wouldn't remember her that well or maybe not at all. She is just a pure joy to listen to and has such a relaxed, pleasant sounding voice.  Her voice is not powerful, but strong enough to deliver all the songs well.  It's also not the babyish sound that you get from someone like Helen Kane.  The sound quality was somewhat flat and slightly muffled, but when you consider the age of these recordings and the fact that they were undoubtedly originally recorded in monophonic, the quality is remarkable.  A couple of the songs had more noise than others, but mostly they have been well restored and one couldn't expect much better.  Just be aware you aren't going to get sharp, clear sound that you would from more modern recordings.  This is a real collector's item of great 20's music.  The habit she has of saying ""That's All!"" at the end of a number of songs was delightful to me, even after I heard it a number of times, but some might find it annoying after a few times.",[],B0000017EA,B0000017EA,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,2007-04-13 05:35:46.000,7,False,Disappointing discovery...
5.0,Still fresh and lively after all these years,This album is from a time when really great instrumentals were lots of fun to listen to.  Some instrumentals from that time were not that good or don't stand the test of time.  This still sounds fresh after 40 years when these two albums were first released.  Good music lasts and lasts and this is lively music that's never boring and always fresh and interesting.  It's a shame that we just don't have artists producing such good instrumentals these days.  Forget about Yanni or Kenny G.  The Stompers really swing and produce the kind of music you feel like dancing to (foot stomping music).  Sound quality seems quite good.

4.0,Incredible Value - Not to be Missed,"Previously a full set of all of Stravinsky's work was well over $200 and since that version is out of print, it sells for far more now.  Where can you get 22 CDs of music for around $30?  I am thrilled with this set, although there is just one small booklet with very little material in it.  A nice plus is that each CD jacket does have the selections listed on the back.  It's a cheapo cardboard box and the CDs are in paper sleeves, but what can one expect for around $30?  If you have always wanted a full set of all Stravinsky's work without paying through the nose for it, this is the set for you.  This set doesn't always contain the best interpretations of Stravinky's work, but most Stravinsky ""fans"" will buy copies of their favorites as well as owning this complete set.  Includes some Stravinsky rehearsals too, as well as a clip of Stravinsky talking about the Rite of Spring.

She sings the bulk of the songs on this album, but the delightful 8-year old Carrie Lyn also sings several songs solo, as well as along with Maria and Norton Buffalo on ""You've Gotta Eat Your Spinach, Baby"" and with Maria on ""We Should Be Together"".  Shirley Temple is fine, but a bit too cutesy at times.  Carrie Lyn does a good job at not being that way.  She doesn't just copy Temple.  She has a nice voice and good delivery.  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this bouncy, fun album.  Technically a very crisp and sharp sound.  The band is superb.

4.0,"Not Extraordinary, But Very Good","This album was my first exposure to Fiona Apple, so I don't have her earlier albums to compare to.  That's good, as each album and each review should stand on it's own.  Fiona has an incredible voice, powerful, but not overpowering.  Some describe it as ""smoky"".  Instead, I would say rich and unique.  Perhaps a little dreamy at times too.  I can't say I am thrilled with any of the songs here, but I did like the title song, which is a little different than anything I've heard before and quite different than the other songs on the album too.  The music doesn't drown out Fiona's voice, so you can tell what she is singing; it's very well-produced.  One fault I find with many modern albums is that the music just overwhelms the artist.  That's not the case here. After listening, I can't say that I hunger for more of Apple's songs, but it will be interesting to see what she comes up with next.  This album certainly showcases her incredible talent.

5.0,Unparalleled; Stunning; Amazing,"There have been many great sounding sister groups, but never one that sounded better than the Lennon Sisters.  Their voices blend together so beautiful, sweetly and harmoniously.  Most of the songs on this album are pop standards that have been done many times by many artists.  So why would I want yet another version?  Because the versions here are done so beautifully that it's like hearing all new songs.  The tunes and the words are familiar, but they sound uniquely different.  Some are slightly different than the version you may have heard before, such as Scarborough Fair. It is wonderfully done, as are all the songs.  In the Lennon Sisters heyday on the Lawrence Welk show, I found them to be just a little too sweet and too cute; their act seemed a little corny or perhaps even contrived to me.  That doesn't come across on this recording at all.  It's hard to find any fault at all, but a few of the songs I am used to hearing done faster.  All the songs are done quite slowly, but it doesn't detract from the sound in the least.  Most of the songs are rather melancholy.  It might have been nice to include one happy, upbeat and perhaps even a humorous or light-hearted song.  Perhaps it would have destroyed the mood?  You will not be disappointed in any way with this album.  Every song is a winner.  Treat yourself to the unique and beautiful voices of the Lennon Sisters.  This is a solid 5-star album.",[],B000000B90,B000000B90,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,2008-05-05 06:10:40.000,1,False,Tedious reading...
4.0,Exciting and heart pounding,"There are only two piano players who I find exciting.  One is Jerry Lee Lewis; the other is Jo Ann Castle.  Jo Ann practically attacks the piano with such gusto and energy that you are afraid the piano will explode into a zillion pieces before she has finished a song.  You have to wonder how many pianos she has broken with her frantic, enthusiastic style.  This is raucous, jazzy, rag-time piano and no one does it better than Castle.  Seeing her play is a real treat, but the excitement is still here in the sound recording.  If you like slow, restful, soft piano pieces, this is NOT for you.  This is loud, brash, bouncy music that just flies out of Castle's piano.  There is a frenzy and an excitement here that just keeps going throughout the album.  I knocked off one star in my rating due to how short the album is.  Maybe it is a good idea to keep it short because your heart will be pounding and the adrenaline will be freely flowing.  Tiger Rag was a little disappointing, but most all the other songs were top notch.",[],B000000BB8,B000000BB8,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,2008-05-06 08:00:11.000,3,False,"Enjoyable, realistic - take a trip to DC!"
3.0,Disappointing Debut Album,"What were they thinking to put out an album like this from the man who wants to sing opera?  This is an odd assortment of songs with only Nessun Dorma from opera.  And what's with singing pop songs in Italian?  Did they not have enough opera songs that Paul was good at so that they had to take other songs that he knew and make them sound like opera?  Then to include the hymns (O Holy Night and Silent Night), which Paul does okay with, but have been done far better by many singers.  The worst stinker on the album is the Spanish version of My Way.  Also Paul has an interesting way of pronouncing MUSIC.  He sings ""Moo-Sick"", rather that ""Mew-Sick"" as most of us say it in the song Music of the Night.  Paul has a way of going deep into the soul (or something like that) and bringing people to tears with his songs. (Yes, me too.)  He is not the best singer, but with that way of getting to people in a very deep way, he will succeed.  Give the man 10 stars, but this recording doesn't rate much more than 3 or 4.  It's a shame and I truly hope this is not the ""one chance"" for Paul Potts to shine.

These are fun, enjoyable songs, even if you don't understand the words.  Suggest you watch a couple of her videos on You Tube to see what she is all about.

If you are tired of same old classical composers, check out Don Gillis and you'll be glad you did.

She didn't move away from country music to go into the mainstream like others such as Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette, so she is not as well known.

After listening I sat the CD aside as one of those mistakes one makes in buying something based totally on unrealized expectations.  After a few days I pulled it out and played again and found I really liked some of the music.  I played it again and discovered that I really liked the entire album and have listened to it enough I can sing along just like I do with Pearl Jam albums or Into the Wild.  Not every Pearl Jam fan will like this but only Eddie Vedder has the guts and the talent to do this kind of CD and be entertaining - at least I have been totally entertained.

3.0,Losing Sleep: Free Fall with a Partially Functioning Chute,"Pop artists are a dime a dozen. Bands continue to form and albums continue to be produced at a rapid pace, with each musical collaboration trying to find the winning formula for success. Parachute, in these respects, is typical of any other young band. The group is hopeful that the formula employed on Losing Sleep will prove to be a winning one that will propel them to commercial success.<br /><br />Losing Sleep's sound is pop- oriented and it's easy to see that the band's influences come from many different musical styles. The songs on this particular album are similar to each other, in that most mesh these different influences into a single sound. Lead singer Will Anderson sings of relationship struggles and offers some emotional renditions as his smooth vocals fill the air with reassurance.<br /><br />This all sounds like the makings of a winning album, but after listening to Losing Sleep all the way through several times, I come away with a feeling of indifference. This isn't to say that the album is bad, because it isn't. The problem I have with these tunes is that none of them offers anything very catchy. Even after repeated listenings, there wasn't a single tune that still stuck in my head. The lyrics are decent and some will even find them poetic and comforting. But the music doesn't offer any catchy hooks, guitar riffs, etc., that make me want to play the album again.<br /><br />That being said, Parachute still seems like a band with potential. The vocal talents of Will Anderson seem to be pretty good and the other band members have shown that they can come together as a cohesive unit of musical artistry. Perhaps future albums will offer a little more musical creativity and a sound that is more memorable.<br /><br />For now, Losing Sleep goes down as an acceptable album with some decent musical efforts that, while not remarkable or incredibly memorable, are still good enough for a passing sample. I'm not overly impressed, but I will keep my radar active for the next Parachute album. This is a good starting point for a young band, and the future may hold some promises and pleasant surprises if they play their cards correctly.",[],B0020H46LK,B0020H46LK,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2009-07-31 18:22:19.000,1,False,"Great, inspirational story.."
5.0,Guided by Voices Does it Again,"Guided by Voices is one of my favorite bands and I look forward to any new release. Space Gun, an album featuring a lineup that includes a few Guided by Voices veterans and some newcomers, is one of the best albums since the band reunited/re-formed a few years back.<br /><br />Space Gun opens strong with the title track, a tight, rocking tune that sets the stage for more great things to come. The band sounds cohesive each step of the way and the songs are consistently good from beginning to end. In many ways, this album reminds me of Earthquake Glue from many years ago, albeit with a little more polish but still with the same raw energy.<br /><br />When you listen to Space Gun, the freshness and catchiness of the tunes might lead you to believe that this is a debut album or something close to that. In reality, it is one in a long line of output from GBV leader Robert Pollard and the fact that he can still write such memorable tunes so many years into his career is a true testament to his songwriting genius.<br /><br />I like each and every song on Space Gun but if pressed to select a top three, my choices would include Blink Blank, Hudson Rake, and I Love Kangaroos. Ask other GBV fans and they will likely select a trio of completely different tunes as their favorites. But that, of course, is one of the appeals of most any Guided by Voices album. While most everyone will agree that all of the songs are noteworthy and memorable, each individual listener will have his/her own set of favorite songs.<br /><br />Space Gun is an album not to miss from one of indie rock’s finest outfits. I love spinning this CD in my car while on long drives, as the songs never grow stale and are always a welcome diversion from the popular tunes on local radio stations. Give Space Gun a whirl yourself, and get hooked on this set of catchy tunes delivered as few other bands can do.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51w1gOWZ4ZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51w1gOWZ4ZL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51w1gOWZ4ZL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B079JPP1HB,B079JPP1HB,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2019-06-06 02:26:21.741,0,True,A Unique Approach
5.0,"Once Again, Robert Pollard Nails It!","I’m a longtime fan of Guided by Voices and I always look forward to any album release. Front man and chief songwriter Bob Pollard has written so many songs that one must wonder if he may eventually run out of steam. But any doubts as to Pollard’s songwriting mastery is quickly put to rest after listening to How Do You Spell Heaven.<br /><br />This album starts and ends strong, with the excellent anchor tracks The Birthday Democrats and Just to Show You. In between are a multitude of melodic and catchy gems, each memorable in its own way. As I have often said- and will say again- the beauty of a Guided by Voices album is that everyone will have his/her own favorite songs, and every single opinion on what song is best will have validity, as they all have something unique to offer.<br /><br />One of the surprises on this album is the track Pearly Gates Smoke Machine. The surprise is that this is an instrumental, which is something GBV is not usually known for. As always, they make it work and work well, as the guitar riffs and direction of the tune keep you transfixed. Sure, I admit that I would have loved to hear Pollard chime in with his thoughtful, brilliant lyrics and when I first listened to this song, I kept expecting exactly that. It never happens, but the music is so catchy I found that I didn’t mind one bit.<br /><br />Selecting my favorite songs on this album, I would go with Just to Show You as my personal favorite track, but I also like Steppenwolf Mausoleum and The Birthday Democrats. It’s all good, really, and it shows that there is absolutely no way to slow down the musical, songwriting genius of Bob Pollard and Guided by Voices. Pollard will still be churning out memorable music to a ripe old age and How Do You Spell Heaven is another GBV album you need to add to your Indie rock rotation.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iUBRvPDhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iUBRvPDhL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iUBRvPDhL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B072NBQN3J,B072NBQN3J,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2019-08-28 19:34:01.446,2,True,"A Pleasure to Read - Vivid Images of Cities, Love and Nature"
4.0,Another Guided by Voices Winner,"Nothing satisfies quite like a new Guided by Voices album. I have listened to them all, dating way back to my younger days when I lived in Dayton, Ohio, the city where the band was born. Every new release is met with anticipation and I am always anxious to discover new musical gems and let Bob Pollard’s songwriting rope me in with its thoughtful lyrics and catchy hooks.<br /><br />Zeppelin Over China contains a total of 32 tracks, including its share of shorter tunes and a few longer, 3 to 4 minute songs. The longer songs are the ones that tend to stick with you and that is certainly true with this album. The standouts on this collection are Jack Tell, Charmless Peters, Think Be a Man, Cold Cold Hands, and My Future in Barcelona. I have a long commute each day to and from work and I rely on albums like Zeppelin Over China to get me through. I find that, among the 32 tracks, the above 5 are the ones I tend to listen to most.<br /><br />I can’t say, however, that every song is excellent and I kind of expected this, given that the album has so many. The title tune, Zeppelin Over China, is about 40 seconds in length and barely qualifies as a song. Then, you have songs like Wrong Turn On that are a little too short and never reach their full potential as a result. The same could be said of the opening track, Good Morning Sir, and others. Even among my favorites, songs like Cold Cold Hands for example, would be even better if they contained another verse or two.<br /><br />Still, all things considered, Zeppelin Over China is a Guided by Voices album worth owning and worth a spin.

In fact, I own one prior Pachelbel CD, already, [[ASIN:B0000C9JCM Pachelbel's Greatest Hit]], which I would highly recommend.  Then I was getting a massage and heard a CD of songs that certainly sounded very similar to Pachelbel, although not quite the Canon in D.  The music was soothing and included ocean sounds.  It turns out that that was this CD: [[ASIN:B000001D05 Pachelbel: Forever By The Sea]].<br /><br />After researching the items on Amazon, I came close to purchasing the one I heard, but I settled on this one instead.  Both are wonderful, but I am really enjoying this one.  I could actually do without the ocean waves (I LOVE the sea, but listening to nature on a CD always feels a bit fake to me), so the music on this album really fits my needs.

One of the things I particularly like is that the vocals are in various languages, which gives this album an eclectic, international feel.

Makena has a lovely voice--in fact, one of my yoga students suggested that he sounds like Peter Yarrow from Peter, Paul, and Mary.  The tunes are melodious, soothing, and perfect for yoga.  A few of the songs have a slight spiritual/Christian slant to them, but not so much that it made me uncomfortable to play them for a general audience.

5.0,"Great relaxing music for yoga, meditation, or similar","I am a yoga instructor, and I recently picked up this album at a used book sale as music to use in my yoga classes.  It did seem a little odd to be buying a CD by Eckhart Tolle, the well-known inspirational book author, but I think of him as more the editor/compiler.  This CD is comprised of many different individual artists, and I was familiar with about half of them, which contributed to my purchase.<br /><br />In particular, Deva Premal is one of my favorite artists to use in my yoga class, and both &#34;Incantation&#34; and &#34;Om Haraum Mitraya&#34; here feature her lovely voice.  Benjy Wertheimer has really nice instrumental offerings, and his &#34;Threshold Between Worlds&#34; contains sounds of slide guitar and other East Asian-like sounds.  Nawang Khechong's Native American flute can be heard on &#34;Wisdom and Compassion.&#34;  I also really like &#34;Heaven's Door,&#34; a quiet piece with piano by Jeff Johnson, and a sweet version of The Beatles' &#34;Let it Be&#34; with Maneesh DeMoor.<br /><br />I'm definitely happy with this purchase, as I use this music for yoga often.

4.0,Nice CD of relaxing background music,"I am a yoga instructor, and I recently picked up this album at a used book sale as music to use in my yoga classes.  I'm also a psychologist, and I found a CD titled &#34;Music to Inspire Positive Thinking&#34; hard to pass up!  I first listened to this in my car.  Overall, the music is pleasant and relaxing, definitely a nice way to wind down on a drive home from work.  I am not sure that I was &#34;inspired&#34; to have positive thinking or otherwise, but I did enjoy the album.<br /><br />It's difficult to speak of specific tracks, as they were fairly indistinguishable to me.  Even the lengths are very similar--the songs all vary from just over 5 minutes to just under 6.5 minutes.  I would be hard-pressed to name a favorite, although &#34;Making Peace&#34; is perhaps the softest and most relaxing, at least in my opinion.  This would make good, indistinct background music for yoga, massage, or similar, and I would recommend it.",[],B001W9FRPG,B001W9FRPG,AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,2017-12-19 19:52:45.015,0,False,Antique Music Box
3.0,Mostly upbeat tunes in this style,"I am a yoga instructor, and I recently picked up this album at a used book sale as music to use in my yoga classes.  I purchased this without knowing anything about the artist but expecting it to be similar to Nawang Khechong's Native American flute music--it's not.  Most of these songs are much more upbeat, which is fine if that is what you want, but which wasn't quite the sound I was seeking.<br /><br />The first track, &#34;Festival of the Sun,&#34; starts with ocean/nature sounds, something I really tend NOT to like when paired with music.  (I guess if I'm listening indoors, the nature sounds don't make sense to me.)  It's a fast-paced tune that seems more Mexican-inspired than Native American, although I'm no music expert.  The next several tracks are similar.  &#34;Shaman's Dream&#34; is a bit slower (although still with a bit), and it includes some of the flute sounds I was hoping for.  I also liked &#34;Temple of the Sun,&#34; a longer (&#62;12 minutes), slower, more dream-like piece.<br /><br />If you are searching for fast-paced Native American music, this CD might be a win for you, but as I noted, I was a bit disappointed.",[],B004YMB0IQ,B004YMB0IQ,AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,2017-12-19 20:01:13.339,1,False,Delicious Writing & Chicago Pizza

As the title suggests, the tracks on this CD are all acoustic and all women.  The offerings are international, featuring women from around the world, and most of the songs are not in English.  Some of the countries represented by these talented women include France, the Czech Republic, Cameroon, Columbia, Croatia, Greece, Portugal, Algeria, and Brazil.<br /><br />Perhaps because English is my only language, I especially enjoy the two English-language tunes, ""Sunnyroad"" by Icelandic singer Emiliana Torrini and ""One Voice"" by the Canadian trio the Wailin' Jennys.  However, I do enjoy the eclectic mix of tunes sung in languages I do not understand.  On the whole, they remind me of music that you might hear in a coffee shop or a classy little ethnic restaurant.  I especially enjoy acoustic music, which seems to blend perfectly with the voices of the women featured.

I Burn For You, 5:19<br /><br />The songs that I already knew included Fortress Around Your Heart, obviously a big hit, and You Still Touch Me, which I like even better.  Of the ones that were new to me, I particularly liked Sacred Love and Ghost Story.  The others were fine, but nothing particularly stood out.

5.0,Great for yoga or as relaxing background music,"I purchased this CD at a used book sale to play during my yoga classes.  My cover is different, so I attached a photo, but the tracks are definitely the same.  This is soft, soothing music appropriate for yoga, massage, or just relaxing.  Some of the tunes, like ""Bodhisattva,"" have elements like bells that might be a little more stimulating, but most are pretty serene--I would say ""Waves of Light,"" ""Surrender,"" and ""Adagio"" are the most peaceful, but the other songs are nice too.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kxis1t93L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kxis1t93L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kxis1t93L._SL256_.jpg'}]",B00000J7AV,B00000J7AV,AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,2019-01-22 19:49:40.729,1,False,Becoming More Aware

I am absolutely not an expert in this type of music, but I really like this set.  All of the tracks feature Das's deep baritone vocals plus a chorus of background singers.  Given the variety of chanting and instruments, most of the songs are pretty upbeat; these are great, but I very much enjoyed the the quiet ""Shri Guru Charanam,"" which includes only Das and (I believe) alto flute; ""Hanuman Puja"" is a similar more tranquil tune.  If you are looking for something a little more energetic, the last three tracks on Disc 2 are the ones I like best.

I did like Wah!'s ""Om Tare,"" which is more of a ballad, and ""The Great Arya Tara,"" a mostly instrumental rendition; the soft tunes ""Tara"" and ""Om Tare Tuttare Ture Soha: were pretty too.  I was surprised that I didn't really enjoy Deva Premal's offering here, as I usually love her.

I picked up this CD at a used book sale, as I love using Cassidy's music for teaching yoga classes.

5.0,So Relaxing; Takes Me Back to Living in the Farmhouse,"When I was in college I lived in my parents’ old farmhouse which had a tin roof. The sound of the rain on that tin roof is probably one of the most soothing sounds I have ever heard in my lifetime and I slept like the dead when it rained at night. The house is gone now and I have moved into a modern house with a normal shingle roof, so I do not get the benefit of listening to the rain on the roof like I did in college. I still like the sound of the rain, but in my bedroom I do not hear the rain when it is coming down most of the time. This CD gives me the opportunity to listen to the rain whenever I want now, which not only helps me to sleep but also provides a very relaxing background in my day.<br /><br />This CD is a single track – one 60-minute recording of nothing but gentle but steady rain falling. As I listen to the recording, I try to identify what the rain is striking as it falls. Some sounds like hitting wet pavement. Some sounds like hitting shallow puddles. Some sounds like hitting a window. It all sounds like it was recorded outside and most sounds are very distinct and clear. It is not the same sound as what rain on a tin roof makes but it is as relaxing.<br /><br />In my home office I have my computer set up with a Bluetooth speaker with a spacial sound feature so it spreads out the sound to make it more natural. With this configuration, the rain sounds so clear, so fresh and natural that it really relaxes me as I work. Yes, this is a CD marketed primarily as a sleep aid, but it is highly relaxing as background noise.<br /><br />As a sleep aid, it works well for me. I usually use a large, steady fan to lull me to sleep, but I like the sound of the rain more than the sound of the fan and the rain takes me back to that farmhouse.<br /><br />This is one of the most relaxing CDs I have ever owned. The recording of the rain reminds me of the rain on the roof of the house my parents owned several years ago, but it also helps me to sleep at night and relax during the day.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

Don't get me wrong, he puts on one heck of a show, but he sure doesn't sound the same as over the airwaves. His opening act, Jon Pardi, that was legit sounding.

The music pushes the envelope, and in any album of hers, but especially this one, you can see different genres utilized and the evidence of her playing and just having a great time creating something new.<br /><br />Crash and Burn Girl, With Every Heartbeat, Konichiwa Bitches, and Be Mine are the top standouts on this album, but you won't find any of the tracks annoying or filler. The songs stay fresh and new with every listen, and if you can get a hold of the single of With Every Heartbeat, with all of the remixes, you won't be sorry to have spent the money.<br /><br />This is a must-buy album for any pop fan, for sure.

4.0,"Nice to have them back,  a grand CD, now GO SEE THEM LIVE!!!","First off, I admit it, I am a huge Flowers fan. I bought this CD as an import from Ireland the day it was released. What makes this Cd so special to me each member of the band wrote for this, with a very strong presence of the writing skills of Bass-mandolin-12 string guitar player Peter Ó Toole. Each song is a moment in time, a story. Each one breathes life. It is worth your money to buy this even just for the 2nd track ""End of the Road"" as far as I am concerned this is the best song about relationshhips ending, and trying to hold on, but knowing you have to let go. This song is amazing. Another standout track is ""Magic Bracelets"" a song written for, and inspired by the late Joe Higgs, reggae master, vocal teacher to Bob Marley, and from what I gather a closet Irishman. The opening track ""Your Love Goes on"" is a blistering bit of dancable funky. The Dublin Gospel Choir backs up on a few tracks including ""Hallelujah"", my only complaint is that they got produced out a bit, they could have brought the volume of the choir up a really good bit, it is nice but sounds to far away and wispy. Wispy is not a word I like to use to dscribe a gospel choir. Nice thought though. I wanted to hear the choir at full throttle and the female lead doing vocal soulful battle with Mr. Ó Maonlai, that would have been utterly perfect now wouldn't it have been?. I say buy this CD, and when the Flowers are in your area, GO SEE THEM LIVE. 'cause that is what it is all about. I love their music, but have yet to hear a CD that comes even close to the worst gig live. They were meant to be heard in person.<br /><br />The best note on this CD is the last track ""Sí Do Mhamo I"" the final track on ""Into Your Heart"" it was recorded live at First Ave. in Minneapolis, and the electricity and excitement of a live gig comes through without being overly produced or tweedled with. I find myself playing this track over and over and over.<br /><br />Why a 4 not a 5? Needs a couple more rocking tracks, needs to have been under-produced a good bit. OK enough of that! BUY IT!

The production the cast etc. were terrific but the show as a whole left you with the feeling of ""What was the point of this show?"" The book was one big mess and at times almost nothing made sense.  To be fair both R&H were very sick while writing this show and the lack of a firm grip on the production lead to a lack of cohesion. Still all and all it is great to have had this production (I can't imagine that there will be many others) recorded and the score striped away from the non-existent book is pleasant though second tier Rodgers and Hammerstein.",[],B008QE9GUM,B008QE9GUM,AFREWIMOI7CCTUV3KOMHQGFFOYLA,2012-10-15 20:32:36.000,0,True,"""Arabian Nights"" will infuse your kitchen with the captivating aromas of the Middle East"
4.0,Good but not Great,"Let me start off by saying that I'm glad I got this recording as it gives you a chance to hear a A- score by Cole Porter in it's entirety.  Having seen seen a production of this a few years ago at Mel Miller's sorely missed ""Musicals Tonight"" series here in NYC,  I was glad to have a chance to revisit the score.  I do find a few ""Problems"" with the recording which stop me from giving it 5 stars. The biggest problem I have is with the conducting which I feel is too laid back and listless. The score needs more oomph and forward momentum then the conductor provided. Take a listen for example to the version of ""When My Baby Comes to Town"" on Thomas Hampson's ""Night and Day"" album and hear how the late John McGlinn really captured the spirit of the times and orchestration of this number. It's full of pep and jazz which I found lacking on the current recording . Listen also how McGlinn puts the zest into ""Leader of a Big Time Band"" on the ""Lorelei"" album or with ""He's the Right Guy"" on that same album with Kim Criswell singing. Both are also a bit lacking on the current recording.  The singing was OK though also needed a ""Bigger"" sound for the roles.  Perhaps I'm nitpicking and looking a ""Gift horse in the mouth"" . As  I said at the start, I'm glad that the recording exists and hope that it leads to some more complete recordings of these forgotten musicals of the past.",[],B07J36923G,B07J36923G,AFREWIMOI7CCTUV3KOMHQGFFOYLA,2019-01-01 00:52:44.440,2,True,An Analysis of Ten Couples' Interactions

5.0,Never get tired of this one - it stands alone,"Even if heavy metal is outside your usual listening spectrum, this is worth hearing. The style draws from several sub-genres: the speed and power of thrash, the big, spacious mixes of power-metal, the growling vocals and dark themes of death-metal. In a sublime alchemy, the result is something more than any of these, in a class totally by itself.<br /><br />Every time I listen to this album after I haven't heard it in a while, I am amazed again at how good it is. The writing and arranging is innovative and expressive. The lyrics are not only meaningful, but for the most part they are intelligible as well--something rare in metal of any kind, especially where the gutteral, growling style of vocals is used. The voices on Sound Over Matter are a highly effective mix of clean and growling styles. The instrumentation is unique: electric guitar and bass guitar, drum kit, cello, and violin. The musicianship is first rate and the production is excellent.<br /><br />The thing that's hard to believe is that Sound Over Matter is the debut album for Hevein! This is a highly polished and sophisticated piece of art, and the superb craftsmanship that went into it only adds to its raw power and intense emotional impact.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41UPcgjIaSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41UPcgjIaSL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41UPcgjIaSL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CWsmrbfVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CWsmrbfVL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CWsmrbfVL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HouThov1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HouThov1L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HouThov1L._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kwdOHaIJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kwdOHaIJL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kwdOHaIJL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B000EHT5K0,B000EHT5K0,AFRY7ELCB7DC4DHTCUVBN477MSUA,2007-03-14 04:27:54.000,1,False,"What's your idea of a ""really good book""?"

4.0,More Exceptional Music From Laura Sullivan,"Late last year I was asked by Laura to review her CD [[ASIN:B000QR0H00 Feast of Joy &amp; Love]] which I absolutely fell in love with (and let's be honest here, I'm a metal-head and prog-rock fanatic) but her music was so calming and relaxing that, no insult intended, it was the best music I've found to help me drift off to sleep. It's also great as background music for reading. I enjoyed the CD she sent so much I decided to support the artist and bought the MP3 copy so I could play it through my Amazon Echo any time I wanted.<br />When Laura again contacted me to tell me she had a new CD, 'The Modern Romantic', come out and would I be interested in receiving an advanced copy of the disc to review I of course said yes. This album, from what I can discern is entirely written and composed by Ms. Sullivan while the previous album contained music both by her and other mainstream composers. 'The Modern Romantic' is quite a bit more mellow and. . . passive than 'Feast of Joy &amp; Love'. I enjoy this new album, not quite as much as 'feast' but I do enjoy it and I was quite touched that she personally signed the album for me. I'm debating buying the MP3 album of this new album but I'm on the fence. 'Feast' is far more what I look for in relaxing music. 'Modern Romantic' is really more suited for what the title implies, setting a romantic mood.  Don't get me wrong it's very good music and I highly recommend Laura Sullivan as an artist. She's absolutely amazing and talented and a very nice and kind person as well.<br />I received this CD in exchange for my review.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IdtxUcGPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IdtxUcGPL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IdtxUcGPL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yeImIfjsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yeImIfjsL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yeImIfjsL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B01D5AAN26,B01D5AAN26,AFUSWNVA72MMWHGYWJ652SYX2JJQ,2016-05-20 17:47:18.000,3,False,"Change your life!

5.0,"Sassy, jiving jump blues from the master","I grew up listening to the blues, soul, and Motown, but I wasn't familiar with Louis Jordan until several months ago, when I purchased this Bear Family box set as a retirement gift for a family member. Jordan was a gifted saxophonist and one of the leading architects of R&B; his prototypes paved the way for Chuck Berry and mainstream rock and roll. Jordan scored 57 R&B chart hits with Decca between 1942-51, and his influence was enormous on blues artists such as Ray Charles and B.B.

There are also a few tunes devoted to large women on You're My Meat and I Like 'Em Fat Like That (tempered, on the other hand, by You're Much Too Fat (and That's That)).<br /><br />Jordan's earliest recordings lack his later polish, and the brass tends to lean more towards Dixieland jazz than tight swing. Early gems include jitterbugs (Doug the Jitterbug), swing (After School Swing Session, At the Swing Cat's Ball), laid-back blues ('Fore Day Blues, Hard Lovin' Blues), and even Bing Crosby-style crooning on Away From You.<br /><br />The subsequent discs include alternate versions for several tracks including Yip, Yip de Hootie with Bing Crosby and Petootie Pie with Ella Fitzgerald, and a tamer version of Open the Door, Richard. Disc 9 is a partial disc at best; it features seven tracks with Ella Fitzgerald, including a spirited version of Baby, It's Cold Outside that puts most other renditions to shame.<br /><br />Bear Family has more than done Louis Jordan justice, with nine CDs and extensive liner notes.

5.0,A national treasure!,"Ella Fitzgerald's interpretations of Great American Songbook gems by Arlen, Gershwin, Porter, Duke Ellington, Rogers and Hart, Mercer, and Kern are timeless. Her impeccable phrasing, sense of humor, and chameleonlike ability to inhabit a song, whether sultry or playful, is teamed with tight orchestrations and flawless remastering on The Complete Ella Fitzgerald Songbooks on Verve.<br /><br />I first became interested in the American Songbook when my cousin gave me a copy of Rod Stewart's [[ASIN:B00006JL4J It Had to Be You... The Great American Songbook]]. My collection quickly expanded to include all of Frank Sinatra's early works on Brunswick with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey and his Columbia works (1942-1953) and 1940s songbook collections by Jo Stafford, Doris Day with Les Brown, and Peggy Lee with Benny Goodman. I first purchased several of Ella Fitzgerald's songbook CDs individually (Gershwin, Porter, and the best of Berlin), and was looking to purchase her Duke Ellington songbook, which retails for about $30. As a member of BMG Music Club, the entire Complete Ella Fitzgerald Songbooks was $89, so I opted for the box set even though I already owned five of the CDs.<br /><br />The 16 CDs are housed in a compact fabric-covered box in individual slipcases (for single CDs) and small cardboard boxes with the original LP artwork and reproduction LP liner notes. My only gripe is the cramped quarters; I switched the CDs to jewel cases for easier access, since it's a pain to constantly have to eject all the cardboard slipcases in search of one CD. The liner notes come in a small fabric-covered hardcover book.<br /><br />You'll find well-known and oft-recorded hits such as Night and Day, Blue Skies, I Got Rhythm, and I Got It Bad, but there are lesser-known gems that are equally entrancing, such as the dreamy, nostalgic My Heart Stood Still(Rogers and Hart), or her starry-eyed The Way You Look Tonight, with its soft sweep of strings and mellow piano. There are even spirited renditions of Wizard of Oz songs such as Over the Rainbow and Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead. Ella's jazzy, punchy delivery on Ding Dong is a satirical, big band romp.<br /><br />The Duke Ellington discs (three in all) were as stellar as I'd dared to hope; tight backing, Ella's dead-on scat singing that lets her jazz it up more than on the ""canonical"" standards. Rockin' in Rhythm features Armstrong-style muted trumpet, a pounding ""Indian"" bassline, and an extended scat melody. Ella's take on I'm Beginning to See The Light is much more playful and sultry than earlier recordings by Jo Stafford and other 40s singers of her ilk.<br /><br />Ella imbues each song with its own magic, bringing a sparkle to even the most tired of covers. The execution is flawless and the sound is timeless. Each time I listen I discover some new nuance, a turn of phrase here, a cleverly punctuated passage there.

5.0,"Spirited, jazzy updates on Christmas classics in Ella's inimitable style","I have nearly twenty Ella Fitzgerald recordings, and she is without a doubt my favorite jazz interpreter of all time. I also have a large collection of Christmas CDs, including Celtic, Polish, and standards, so when I finally got my hands on a copy of Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas, I was thrilled.<br /><br />Containing eighteen tracks (including several alternate takes), you'll find swinging covers of Jingle Bells, Sleigh Ride, Frosty, and Let It Snow!, along with some surprising choices such as Good Morning Blues and an upbeat Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas. Ella's tight phrasing and genius timing make these old standards swing, but she also shows a sultrier side on What Are You Doing New Year's Eve. Christmas Island is a fun Andrew Sisters / Der Bingle jingle that hearkens back to WWII.<br /><br />Ella uses her indomitable sense of playfulness to rejuvenate some potentially tired Christmas classics; nowhere is this more evident than on an alternate take of Frosty, where she adopts a little-girl pout complete with lisp. It was cute for one listen, but I found myself skipping over it on subsequent plays. Another fact that was a bit jarring was that the alternate tracks were not from the same sessions as the album tracks; they were recorded with a different orchestra as well. But the remastered sound quality is impeccable, and Ella's never sounded better.

5.0,A satisfying glimpse of an ambitious rising star,"Frank Sinatra, son of a fireman, dropped out of high school as a senior to pursue a career in music. At 20, Frank Sinatra started out singing with the Hoboken Four, then as a singing waiter, but had his eye on bigger fish. In 1939 he signed with trumpeter and bandleader Harry James ([[ASIN:B000002ARA The Complete Recordings Nineteen Thirty-Nine]]). The next year, he left to join Tommy Dorsey's band as vocalist ([[ASIN:B000002WPO The Song Is You]]), until he set out for a solo career with Columbia Records in 1943. These early years were previously available on the excellent (and now-out-of-print) box set The Song Is You and the single CD reissue of The Complete Harry James and Frank Sinatra. However, a new Sony box set, [[ASIN:B000UYT9SK A Voice in Time: 1939-1952]], combines this pre-Columbia Brunswick material with Sinatra's Columbia gems and airchecks. If you're looking for a more complete portrait of early Frank, you're better off buying the new A Voice In Time release.<br /><br />The Columbia Years, 1943-1952<br /><br />Frank signed with Columbia in 1943, although the groundwork had already been laid for his first solo album The Voice of Frank Sinatra with several Cole Porter recordings in 1942 (arranged by Axel Stordahl). Throughout the mid-1940s, Sinatra appeared in numerous films and radio series. The Best of the Columbia Years conveniently lists songs by the film that they appeared in; nearly all of the Great American Songbook composers make appearances, including Gershwin, Berlin, Rogers and Hammerstein, Porter, Kern, Arlen, and Mercer.<br /><br />By the early 1950s, Sinatra was increasingly at odds with Columbia head Mitch Miller, who relied on having his stars record silly novelty songs to boost ratings. Miller was also in favor of overdubbing, where the technically exacting Sinatra preferred recording with a live band and backup singers. Miller's demands that Sinatra record the truly awful ""Mama Will Bark"" (thankfully omitted here), and his perception that Sinatra was already a washed-up teen idol, led to Sinatra's switch to Capitol Records in 1953, where he had the last laugh on Miller (and the rest is music history).<br /><br />The original Frank Sinatra: The Columbia Years: The Complete Recordings was a massive twelve-CD, 285-track epic collection of Frank's entire Columbia catalog (hideous novelties included). This four-CD, 97-track distillation offers the highlights, including many memorable original recordings (as opposed to later Capitol and Reprise rerecordings) of seminal American Songbook classics such as Night and Day, All of Me, You Do Something To Me, Where or When, How Deep is the Ocean, etc.<br /><br />Packaging<br /><br />The Best of the Columbia Years comes in at least two versions: a longbox, and a more compact, traditional four-CD set in a slipcase. I own the longbox version. Two CDs are stored vertically on the front and back plates, and the nearly 70 pages of liner notes are full of rare photographs of Frank and family, essays by Sinatra expert Will Friedwald, orchestra personnel listings, alphabetical song listings, and a discography.<br /><br />It's clear that this was a labor of love, and it is a collection to be treasured, especially since the original Complete Columbia Recordings has been out of print for several years. The sound quality is impeccable, the songs themselves are a reflection on a simpler time long past, and the liner notes are full of personal recollections and trivia.

5.0,Contemporary updates to a classical form,"Fado, traditional Portuguese ballads of love and loss, are a melancholy counterpart to Spain's raw flamenco. Traditionally backed by a Portuguese steel string guitar, fado is the raw lament of saudade, or yearning. Although fado can trace its roots back to the 1800s, Amalia Rodrigues was considered to be *the* modern fado superstar. Numerous other Portuguese fado divas have since attempted to fill her shoes, including Dulce Pontes, Cristina Branco, Madredeus, Misia, and Mariza.<br /><br />I remember seeing Paixoes Diagonais at the record store where I used to work, but my first exposure to Misia was her later [[ASIN:B0000C8WYW Canto]] CD that we received as in-store play. I'd long been attracted to the fiery percussive rhythms of Spanish flamenco, but fado is flamenco's darker, quieter self-pitying sister, content to sit in a smoky corner and lament the absence of love, luck, etc. Despite its depressing nature (a friend of mine described fado as ""a suicidal soundtrack""), fado is addictive. Fado houses (clubs) are all the rage in Lisbon.<br /><br />On Paixoes Diagonais, Misia updates the traditional singer-and-a-guitar setting of traditional fado and mixes it with more contemporary backings, including piano, accordion and strings. The results are stellar, lifting fado into another realm, from hints of sultry tango on Liberdade Poeticas, Parisian accordion on A palavra dos lugares and Celtic-influenced strings on Ainda que. Her soulful delivery is uniformly excellent, lending a sense of melancholy urgency that is buoyed along by the Portuguese guitar. The addition of strings and piano serve to soften some of the rougher edges and add variety to a normally guitar-only program.",[],B00002MZ4A,B00002MZ4A,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-03-14 02:50:24.000,1,False,Nazi war criminal in hiding tells all....
4.0,D'elles: here's one for the girls,"D'elles is Celine's follow up to 1995's bestselling [[ASIN:B000024JE2 D'Eux]] and as such, is a shout-out to grrrl power (the clinical-sounding official line is ""a concept project that celebrates womanhood""). The lyrics for the thirteen songs were written by well-known female authors from Belgium, France, and Canada, including Fran'oise Dorin, Christine Orban, Nina Bouraoui, Marie Laberge, Lise Payette, Denise Bombardier, Nathalie Nechtschein, Jovette Alice Bernier, Janette Bertrand and George Sand (Baroness Dudevant).<br /><br />The studio wizards include the four collaborators on Celine's last French album [[ASIN:B0000DJZ7W 1 Fille & 4 Types]]: Jean-Jacques Goldman (music supervisor), Jacques Veneruso, Erick Benzi, and Gildas Arzel (the ""four guys"" referred to in the title of her earlier work). My favorite Acadien singer-songwriter Jean-Francois Breau ([[ASIN:B000DZJHSI Expose]]) also contributes his songwriting expertise.<br /><br />Some of the thirteen songs have uptempo flirtations with dance music (Et s'il n'en restait qu'une, A cause), while others are gentle slow ballads (On s'est aime a cause, Je ne suis pas celle). We even see Celine ""duetting"" with the late Maria Callas through studio wizardry on La diva, although Celine sings along so softly with Callas that it's difficult to hear how her operatic aspirations measure up. Another of the more experimental tracks is Lettre a George Sand, in which Celine recites the text of a letter from George Sand and dissolves into a melody that somehow reminded me of my grandfather's favorite religious song ""Prayer of St. Francis."" My least-favorite track was the grating lullaby Berceuse, in which Celine merely whispers the words and infinitely repeats the ""Mama t'aime"" (""Mommy loves you"") chorus ad nauseum.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pleasant, if sometimes bland, listening experience that makes for pleasant background music, but for the most part, the songs blended together and weren't instantly memorable on first listen. Also beware if you buy the deluxe edition from France: the bonus DVD is Region 2 PAL only; Amazon.com didn't specify that, and I ended up returning my copy since it was pointless paying $26 for a disc I couldn't play (I had erroneously assumed that the deluxe edition was the Canadian, not European import, and it was not labeled as such).",[],B000N3AWDE,B000N3AWDE,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-03-14 02:59:04.000,5,False,Disappointing...
5.0,"Although over thirty years old, this two-disc set shines","Jordi Savall, eminent violist hailing from Catalunya, once again works his period magic with the help of Hesperion XX. Savall is perhaps best-known for his recordings of French Baroque music by Lully, Sainte Colombe and Marais (for example, [[ASIN:B00005S0MD Tous Les Matins du Monde/Dix Ans Apres]]), although he has extensively explored other early music genres such as Spain's Golden Age or Eastern music from Turkey, Afghanistan, and beyond.<br /><br />On Music from Christian and Jewish Spain, Savall has divided the work into two separate discs. The first disc is devoted to Spanish court music from Spain's Age of Discoveries (1492-1553), consisting mainly of villancicos, romances, and recercadas. This is not my main area of expertise, but I would venture that these are court dances. According to the sparse liner notes, villancicos feature homophonic writing and contrast between the refrain and stanza, while romances are long narrative poems with ornamentation. The Cancionera de la Colombina relates to the son of Christopher Columbus.<br /><br />The second disc is what primarily interests me; it's a lovely selection of Sephardic Romances (prior to 1492, when all Jews and Moors were expelled from Spain on the order of Isabella). Sephardim Jews had lived in Spain for centuries, with large communities in Cordoba and Toledo, and wrote many beautiful works in Ladino, a cross between Hebrew and Old Castilian (written in the Hebrew alphabet, Ladino is easy to read for a Spanish speaker when transcribed with the Latin alphabet). These haunting ballads are strongly influenced by Arabic musical modalities (Spain was under Islamic control from 711 CE-1492 CE, when Granada was captured by los Reyes Catolicos, Ferdinand and Isabella). After the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, Sephardim dispersed to Portugal, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, and beyond, taking their language, culture, and music with them (the beautiful cover art is taken from an early 14th-century Hebrew bible from Portugal).<br /><br />Savall's wife, soprano Montserrat Figueras, sounds equally at home on both the Christian villancicos and the Sephardic romances, but of the two styles, I felt that she really shined when singing in Ladino; the combination of period instruments such as Saracen chitarra and Figueras's haunting delivery make you feel as though you've just stepped back in time. There's a stark contrast between the heavily ornamented style of the Spanish court music (heavy on strings) and the sparse backing of the Sephardic ballads, where the focus is on the lyrics and the singer. Some songs feature heavy use of Arabic percussion (Una matica de ruda).<br /><br />Overall, this is a beautiful, balanced look at two major styles of period Spanish music (the third, and one of my favorites, is mudejar, the culture of Muslims who remained under Christian rulers until their expulsion in 1492). It has been digitally remastered and sounds as fresh as if it had been recorded yesterday. Savall also revisited Sephardic ballads on the more recent release [[ASIN:B00004RBWV Di&aacute;spora Sefard&iacute;]], also featuring vocals by Montserrat Figueras, but Music from Christian and Jewish Spain is still an excellent introduction to both early Christian court music and Sephardic ballads.",[],B00000J2QD,B00000J2QD,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-03-19 11:28:13.000,4,False,"A treat for sailing enthusiasts, and the rest of us, as well!"
5.0,A pairing made in heaven...,"Long before she became known as a sultry sex kitten with 1950's smash hit Fever, Peggy Lee had practiced her sexier side with Benny Goodman on hits such as Why Don't You Do Right. Lee received her big break in 1941 when Benny Goodman heard her sing; his vocalist Helen Forrest was about to leave his band, and he was looking for a replacement. A few days later, Lee recorded Elmer's Tune, the first track on The Complete Recordings 1941-1947. That same year, several more of Lee/Goodman's arrangements went on to be hits, including I Got It Bad and Winter Weather.<br /><br />The Complete Recordings gathers 38 tracks by Lee and Goodman, despite the fact that Lee married Goodman's guitarist Dave Barbour and took a year off, returning to work on her solo career with Barbour (in 1945, she signed a solo contract with Capitol). 32 of the tracks were recorded between 1941 and 1942 and displayed Peggy Lee's widening range to perfection, from blues (Blues in the Night), ballads (How Deep is the Ocean?, How Long Has This Been Going On?, When the Roses Bloom Again, Where or When, The Way You Look Tonight), holiday tunes (Winter Weather), uptempo numbers (Let's Do It, The Freedom Train), and everything in between. It's amazing to hear how she matures from that first jittery performance on Elmer's Tune to the confident vocalist she'd become.<br /><br />The remastering has produced a crisp, clear sound, and the discs are printed to look like the old vinyl labels that Columbia's used with Frank Sinatra reissues. The excellent liner notes are by the incomparable Will Friedwald, who writes for all the Sinatra Columbia / Capitol reissues and releases, and include rare photos and a complete list of original catalog numbers, recording dates, and studio personnel.

A pity, since their strong, polished homage to blues, early rock, and soul really shines on Cry Wilf! from 1986. Hunter plays blues harp, guitar, and sings, while guitarist Dot and bassist Tony Hilton round out the crew.<br /><br />Cry Wilf! is basically a cover album with a few original tunes thrown in; the reverse of what Hunter would include on his three solo albums [[ASIN:B000GNOSKY ...Believe What I Say]] (1996), [[ASIN:B0000259AM Kick It Around]](2001), and [[ASIN:B000E1NX1S People Gonna Talk]](2006), including songs by Lee Dorsey (Ya Ya), Barbara Lewis (Hello Stranger), Ike Turner (Get Over It Baby), Walter Jacobs (Boom Boom), and Willie Dixon (Mellow Down Easy). The original songs Got A Thing For You, Same Old Nuthin', Can't Stand It No More and Shake It hold up well compared to the established classics in their fidelity to retro songwriting and instrumentation.<br /><br />Hunter plays a mean blues harp, a talent which I didn't know he possessed based on his later solo work and stints with Van Morrison. His guitar chops are also solid, at times borrowing from established bluesmen, at times straying into Chuck Berry territory and even a touch of surf guitar. Hunter's raspy, soulful voice is perfectly suited to these tales of hard living (and loving), and his band is tight (the only welcome addition would be keyboards/Hammond organ).<br /><br />Hunter is more guttural, more emotional, and less composed than on his solo albums, where he spends more time cultivating a soul blues persona a la Sam Cooke, and I found this grittier, soulful side of James a pleasant departure from his carefully crafted ballads such as Mollena on more recent releases. It's amazing to hear him when he was just starting out on his musical career; not bad for a boy from Colchester, England who grew up in a trailer in an onion field and worked on the railroad before pursuing his passion for retro soul, blues, and R&B full-time.

4.0,Continues Hunter's tradition of strong original R&B / soul,"James Hunter first appeared on Britain's blue-eyed soul scene as [[ASIN:B000HOJNI4 Cry Wilf!]] back in 1986, with gritty, smokin' covers of blues classics such as Boom Boom and R&B covers of Ike Turner, Barbara Lewis, and Willie Dixon. On his first Ace solo album [[ASIN:B000GNOSKY ...Believe What I Say]], released in 1996, Hunter had found a more polished, smooth soul sound reminiscent of Otis Redding and Sam Cooke, with many original songs such as the ballad Believe What I Say and uptempo jam Two Can Play and the gospel-inspired Let Me Know and Hear Me Calling.<br /><br />On his second solo album Kick It Around, published on Germany's RUF Records, Hunter again relies on his solid band and tight songwriting skills to produce a short but sweet miracle of retro songwriting. Too many modern artists attempt to channel the golden age of soul and R&B but too often come off as uninspired, or worse, as a cliche. Hunter has the rare ability to capture the lyrics, studio sound, horn sections, and jivin' guitar, resulting in nuanced recordings that sound like they've been transported directly from the 1960s. As with his first solo album, Hunter has produced another original album full of memorable soft ballads such as Mollena, It's Easy to Say, and Tell Her for Me, as well as a stellar cover of Clyde McPhatter's Lover's Question that threatens to upstage the original. Better Luck Next Time is a hilarious tribute to Roy C.'s Shotgun Wedding. There's also a tight James Brown-inspired instrumental on the rockin' Night Bus, a nod to James's Night Train.<br /><br />Four of the songs on Kick It Around were revived on [[ASIN:B000E1NX1S People Gonna Talk]]from 2006 (It's Easy To Say, Kick It Around, Mollena, and Tell Her For Me), which is a good thing considering that Kick It Around is currently out of print. It's a mystery to me why Lover's Question wasn't given similar treatment, and I'm glad that I managed to track down a new copy of Kick It Around.

5.0,"The ""missing link"" in Sinatra's early Columbia career","What should have been a momentous occasion, that of Frank Sinatra's signing to Columbia and striking out on a solo career after fronting for Harry James and Tommy Dorsey, was nearly silent due to a commercial recording ban enforced by the Musicians Union from mid-1942 to 1944. Because the ban affected instrumental musicians, vocal-only recordings were allowed, meaning that Sinatra and Axel Stordahl had to come up with alternate vocal-backed arrangements that may not have ordinarily been chosen. The second loophole was that instrumentals were allowed on V-Discs, free recordings for the sole use of GIs overseas that were supposed to be destroyed when the war ended (the Library of Congress was allowed to keep one of each disc for posterity).<br /><br />Sinatra's V-Disc material encompasses 53 songs on two CDs, including material from airchecks as well as studio performances. There are many well-known Sinatra Columbia tunes such as All of Me, Nancy with the Laughing Face, Close to You, Ol' Man River, All the Things You Are, and She's Funny That Way, but many of the brightest gems are songs that Sinatra never got around to recording commercially for Columbia, such as Long Ago and Far Away, You've Got a Hold On Me, Hot Time in the Town of Berlin, Just Close Your Eyes, Come Rain or Come Shine and Noel Coward's I'll Follow My Secret Heart.<br /><br />Guests include Dinah Shore, The Pied Pipers and Tommy Dorsey. The remastering and clean-up of these decades-old songs is flawless, and Sinatra's charm is as fresh as ever. His transition from boy singer to teen idol shows him singing with remarkable poise and confidence, and Axel Stordahl's touch is unmistakable.

Many of the songs appear on the band's major release [[ASIN:B000HOJNI4 Cry Wilf!]], with several other prime additions such as Big Joe Williams' Baby Please Don't Go.<br /><br />James is totally in control, performing some excellent blues harp (which is largely absent on his more recent releases such as Kick it Around and People Gonna Talk). He and Dot (who later went on to join the short-lived Shout Sister Shout) also engage in some high-energy guitar duels on the encore Boogie. T-Box does an awesome turn on the string bass, making me wonder once again why it's such an underutilized (and underappreciated) instrument in modern music (with the exception of jazz). Hunter seems to be perfectly at home on stage, and he goes as far as smoking cigarettes during songs and between sets (that might explain his vocal quality, but let's see THAT happen in modern concert halls!).<br /><br />Hunter displays a lot of energy on stage, dancing around with his guitar and jamming during harp solos. As with his CD Cry Wilf!, this is a more guttural, less polished sound that has more in common with early bluesmen such as Muddy Waters than on James's more recent releases, which featured a polished, slicked-back Sam Cooke production. James is displaying his grittier side, and it works in a way that's missing from People Gonna Talk, bringing the songs some urgency. The only miss is his cover of God Bless the Child, which isn't flattering at all to his raspy delivery.<br /><br />The video quality is poor (apparently transferred from videotape), and the sound is decent. Don't expect any flashy extras; this looks (and sounds) like a low-budget release from the UK (I found the root menu still of James to be grainy and particularly unflattering). But as a historic document of James's early talent for assimilating R&B, soul, rock, and blues from the 1950s-1960s and giving it a fresh, modern twist, it's priceless and well worth at least one viewing for fans of Hunter's more recent work.<br /><br />Tracklisting:<br />* Got A Thing For You<br />* Got My Eyes On You<br />* Rockingitus<br />* Ya Ya<br />* I Know You Don't Love Me<br />* 21 Days In Jail<br />* Mellow Down Easy<br />* God Bless The Child<br />* Baby Please Don't Go<br />* Boogie",[],B000PMFPLW,B000PMFPLW,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-04-08 23:22:19.000,1,False,A cozy Pitt mystery series finale!
4.0,Haunting Eastern Christian legacy...,"Maronites (Antiochian) and Melchites (Byzantine) are members of the Eastern Catholic Church, with a heritage dating back to the origins of Christianity. Maronites were at one time the most populous majority in Lebanon, and Sister Marie Keyrouz (of Lebanon) does a stunning job of bringing the Maronite musical heritage to life.<br /><br />Maronite chant is strophic, syllabic, and monodic, with a range limited to a fourth or a fifth. Despite the Christian nature of the texts, at first listen, the music is purely Middle Eastern, following the vocalization of Arabic classical music. Maronite chant is a capella and based on texts in the Syriac (Aramaic) language, which was one of the earliest languages used by Christian communities. The first disc consists of songs for Christmas, the Passion, and Resurrection (French and English translations are provided in the scant liner notes) taken from the Maronite, Syrian Orthodox and Syrian Christian traditions. Sister Marie Keyrouz's voice is powerful and deeply spiritual, drawing the listener deeper into the trancelike chant despite the language barrier.<br /><br />Traditionally, only four instruments are used in the Maronite Church: double cymbals, the large cymbal, the naqus (similar to a triangle) and the maraweh (similar to a cymbal). Their usage is generally limited to holidays such as Christmas and Easter. The harmonium, organ, violin and other stringed instruments are more recent additions. This limited use of instruments places full emphasis on the power of the texts.<br /><br />The second disc comes from the Byzantine tradition, and features the liturgical cycle of the Passion and Resurrection. The texts are in Arabic, Syriac, and Greek. As with Disc One, these chants are supremely powerful even if you do not understand the lyrics, and are deliciously exotic to Western ears. When I was younger, I listened to Gregorian chant, and after living in Spain in 2005, I purchased a disc of the Mozarabic rite performed in Toledo, and at the same time became interested in Eastern Christian chant, including Melchite and Maronite. I have always been drawn to Eastern music from Turkey, Egypt, and the Middle East, and was enchanted when I happened upon this recording by Marie Keyrouz.<br /><br />Sister Marie Keyrouz is somewhat of a celebrity in Europe and the Middle East, as her many CD and DVD releases attest (as does her flashy website at keyrouz.com). Unfortunately, the liner notes are skimpy and feature sparse notes in French and English, along with photos of iconography and Christian sites in Lebanon.",[],B00061GYNA,B00061GYNA,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-04-08 23:27:11.000,7,False,Is she still alive?
3.0,Norah goes a little country,"On Feels Like Home, Norah Jones's sophomore album, she explored a more country-themed sound appropriate to her Texan roots and foreshadows her work with The Little Willies. The opening track Sunrise has percussion reminiscent of a horse's hooves clip-clopping away on some dusty trail straight out of an old Western, while What Am I To You flirts with blues that call to mind Norah's performance on Peter Malick's New York City. Be Here to Love Me is a beautiful slow waltz, while Creepin' In is a spirited, buoyant duet with Dolly Parton(!) laced with slide guitar. Long Way Home has a bouncy backing that reminds me of a jug band, while Humble Me is a steel-string guitar and Norah's soft croon. The remaining tracks capture the sort of laid-back (some critics called it ""sopophoric"") sound that Norah made famous on her debut [[ASIN:B00005YW4H Come Away with Me]], albeit with more of a countryish edge (steel guitar, lilting country and western rhythms).<br /><br />To be honest, I was working at a Barnes & Noble music department when this album was released, and I instantly took a dislike to it and tried to tune it out when we used it as in-store play. I wasn't terribly fond of the country overtones (country is one of the few musical genres that I can't stand, even though I live in Texas!), the songs weren't memorable, and there was a stylistic mismatch between the country tracks and Norah's other playing/writing style; Feels Like Home felt like it wasn't quite sure what it was trying to be. However, when I was recently on vacation and heard this played in a shop, I was drawn to it and decided to give it a second chance. I would place this second out of Norah's three albums so far (I really didn't like Not Too Late), and if you're a fan of country, you might like this more than I did. It does have some well-written songs and Norah's wonderful piano and voice to recommend it, but I still think that Norah's first album was her most versatile due to its seamless fusing of standards, country, and jazz. Feels Like Home felt less balanced overall.",[],B00018D44U,B00018D44U,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-04-08 23:31:40.000,0,False,Not your usual Hitchcockian-type mystery!
5.0,Rod revives WWII-era standards with wit and panache,"On It Had To Be You: The Great American Songbook Vol. 1 by Rod ""the Bod"" Stewart, Rod lovingly resuscitates WWII-era standards by Gershwin, Kern, Porter, and others in a laid-back ballroom style. Opening with They Can't Take That Away From Me, the strummed guitar, reminiscent of manouche Jazz a la Django, provides a swaggering backing for Rod's playful delivery (this song has become known as ""the Knife Song"" in my house due to an family tradition of a glass of wine and someone waving a knife in the air during the lyric ""the way you hold your knife""). The Way You Look Tonight opens with a sparse, nostalgic pianissimo piano solo and sliding into soft snare brushes as Rod croons the lyrics softly.<br /><br />Rod's delivery alternates between a wistful, lovestruck tone on softer, slower songs such as The Nearness of You, For All We Know, and The Nearness of You, or a playful, dashing sort of tossed-off delivery as the lyrics require (You Go To My Head, Moonglow, These Foolish Things). There are jazzier touches such as the blues-inspired intro on Moonglow, or the manouche guitar on For All We Know.<br /><br />Rod's band really shines on providing a retro-sounding backing suitable for candlelit dinners or soft, slow dancing, featuring numerous studio musicians on piano and synth, bass, guitar, and drums and guests Dave Koz on tenor sax and Arturo Sandoval and Chris Botti on trumpet. If I had to sum up the mood, it would be ""low key."" This is wonderfully relaxed and free of too-modern arrangements. Rod's voice may have a scratchier edge than true '40s-era crooners such as Sinatra, but he really inhabits the songs with a playfulness and respect that make him utterly believable in the role of crooner. Even if you're not a fan of Rod's earlier recordings, just give It Had To Be You a try; you may just fall madly in love with these songs, as I did.<br /><br />Many critics have commented that these songs don't suit Rod's whiskey voice, but I disagree. For one thing, I, too, grew up hearing Rod's rock persona from his 1970s recordings, so I'm no stranger to his more famous hits such as Maggie May. In fact, this album, which I heard for the first time in 2003, was a watershed moment on my musical tastes and started me on a journey collecting authentic 1940s recordings by Glenn Miller, Tommey Dorsey, Harry James, all of Frank Sinatra's Brunswick and Columbia material, and '40s vocal collections by Jo Stafford, Peggy Lee, and Doris Day. If it hadn't have been for Rod's impassioned delivery, I wouldn't have become interested in the Great American Songbook.<br /><br />If I had to venture a guess, it would be that Rod has done for revival of the Great American Songbook and WWII standards what Sarah Brightman has done for the popularity of classical crossover, creating the first successful albums that would inspire new genres and artists to flourish. This isn't to say that he's the first to do so; Linda Ronstadt's [[ASIN:B000002H1F What's New]] and [[ASIN:B000002H3S 'Round Midnight]] and Natalie Cole's [[ASIN:B000002H8X Unforgettable: With Love]] and [[ASIN:B000002HN6 Stardust]] were on the market in the early 1990s.<br /><br />My only disappointment with It Had To Be You was the fact that the subsequent albums never matched the brilliance of the original; [[ASIN:B0000C9ZEX As Time Goes By...The Great American Songbook: Volume II]], [[ASIN:B0002X94Y8 Stardust... The Great American Songbook, Vol. III]], and [[ASIN:B000B7HZXM Thanks For The Memory...The Great American Songbook IV]] featured some lackluster duets with other music celebs and some of the best songs were already covered on this album. After the success of It Had To Be You, practically everybody cashed in on the Songbook hype, including Michael Bolton ([[ASIN:B0000AQS8A Vintage]]), Cyndi Lauper ([[ASIN:B0000DG06E At Last]]), and Carly Simon ([[ASIN:B0009PLM4Y Moonlight Serenade]]).<br /><br />This album will appeal to several generations: the Greatest Generation that lived through WWII and remember these songs firsthand, the Baby Boomers that may have grown up hearing these, and finally, my generation (Gen X), who will probably be hearing many of these classics for the first time. Hats off to Rod for preserving and renewing interest in an important American musical legacy that threatened to be lost to fading memories and the ravages of time.",[],B00006JL4J,B00006JL4J,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-04-08 23:40:01.000,1,False,Wonderful excuse to sit down for some quiet time!
5.0,It's about time! A reissue of one of Celine's great early albums,"Du Soleil au Coeur was the first Celine album to be released in France and debuted in October, 1983. The album went gold (over 700,000 copies sold), but has never been released on CD in its entirity (fourteen of the fifteen songs are frequently recycled on Celine French-language compilations) until now.<br /><br />Du Soleil au Coeur featured some of Celine's most enduring French songs from her early career, such as D'Amour ou d'Amitie (Love or Friendship), the pensive Mon Ami M'a Quittee (My Boyfriend Left Me), Quatre Pas d'Ici (the adapted version of Bucks Fizz's Land of Make Believe), the tender maternal ode Tellement J'Ai d'Amour Pour Toi (I Have So Much Love for You), and the peppy Hello Mister Sam. The original ten-track tracklisting has been preserved from the original LP, and one new addition is the CD version of Vieux Monsieur de La Rue Royale, which was previously unavailable on CD. Five additional tracks (all previously available on other compilations) are also included.<br /><br />We're treated to a younger, confident, and absolutely captivating Celine who possesses these songs and makes them her own. Many were penned by the legendary Eddy Marnay, who collaborated with Celine on all of her albums until 1987's [[ASIN:B000007U0Q Incognito]], when Celine switched to Luc Plamondon as primary songwriter as she was looking for an edgier, rock-oriented sound. Let's hope that Celine's other early albums are eventually remastered and reissued; there are dozens of great Celine songs from 1981-1987 that have never been released to CD. If you've never listened to Celine's first albums in French, you owe it to yourself to hear how impressive she was even as a teenager (personally, I prefer her 1981-1987 albums to anything she recorded after).",[],B00005JRZL,B00005JRZL,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-05-31 19:53:54.000,7,False,Every patient should read this - and give a copy to his doctor!
4.0,Garou's first English CD doesn't disappoint,"After being discovered singing in Sherbrooke's bars, Garou rocketed to fame in 1997 starring as Quasimodo in Luc Plamondon's [[ASIN:B00004U2EZ Notre Dame de Paris]]. His debut album [[ASIN:B0000501CN Seul]] was followed by [[ASIN:B0001ZA16M Reviens]] and [[ASIN:B000F8ZNAY Garou]]. During this time, Garou was under the management of Celine Dion's husband Rene Angelil. There had been rumors for years regarding his first English album, and Corey Hart even mentioned writing two songs for it (""10,000 Horses"" and ""In Your Sweater"") on his website. But other than the rare English cover of ""Dust in the Wind"" on [[ASIN:B0002IQDA6 Within]]  and the English-langauge recording of [[ASIN:B00004TRMK Notre Dame De Paris (Music From the Show]], fans have had to wait for ""Piece of My Soul.""<br /><br />""Piece of My Soul"" also marks Garou's departure from Rene Angelil in order to start his own label, Wolfgang, and to devote more time to a film/TV career. This also marks a departure from his strong team of French-language songwriters such as Eric Lapointe, Didier Barbelivien, Jacques Veneruso, and Gildas Arzel. However, he gets some well-known help from Rob Thomas on Stand Up, Enrique Iglesias on The First Day of My Life and Ronan Hardiman on What's the Time In NYC. In a change from his previous albums, All the Way is penned by Garou himself in a double-entendre homage to two of his great loves: poker and women (he's credited by his real name Pierre Garand;  Corey Hart's songs seemed to have disappeared by the wayside). Like many Quebecois, Garou's bilingual; his English diction is mostly flawless (for most of his early career he was singing covers of English-language R&B and pop).  The ballads are well crafted and mainly low-key, and this definitely deserves a listen if you've never before heard Garou. I found Heaven's Table to be particularly mesmerizing, and the haunting Nothing Else Matters, based on the 2005 tsunami.<br /><br />It seems that Sony BMG Canada isn't putting a lot of promotional effort / funds into Garou's first English CD; more than a month after its domestic release in Canada, I only found one (not very favorable) review in the Montreal Gazette, and there's no release date listed for the US.  Surprising, since Rob Thomas and Enrique Iglesias are bankable names in the States. It's a pity, really, because as usual Garou pours his heart and soul into bringing the thirteen songs to life, and this would have been a perfect break into the market south of the (Canadian) border: oh, and it doesn't hurt that Garou's versatile (he plays several instruments including guitar, piano, and trumpet), charming, easy on the eyes, and has a wicked sense of humor in French and English. I only hope that ""Piece of My Soul"" will receive a launch in the US  so that Garou gets the attention he deserves; his albums are head and shoulders above the prefab blandness crowding our ClearChannel airwaves.",[],B0014SM9FQ,B0014SM9FQ,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-06-14 22:43:45.000,12,False,"Sweet story, great artwork!"
4.0,Vive le Quebec!,"Ever had that amazing sense of deja vu? As I was in my local Texas Barnes and Noble, I heard an in-store CD that shocked me for its obscurity; I was sure that the voice belonged to one of the members of Kashtin, a First Nations Innu band from Quebec that had disbanded some time ago as both members pursued solo careers. I thought ""that's impossible, why would they be playing Quebecois First Nations music in Texas? And from a band as obscure as Kashtin?"" (Kashtin's Akua Tuta received airplay on the [[ASIN:B000005DDI Due South: The Original Television Soundtrack]]). I ran back to the music department only to find that Putumayo's latest compilation embraced my first love, Quebec.<br /><br />As someone who has a French major with an emphasis on Quebec Studies and studied for two summers at Universite Laval in Ste-Foy, Quebec, I can attest that this special anniversary CD (the 400th anniversary of Quebec City's founding by Champlain) is a bit eclectic to thoroughly represent the broad range of Quebecois music, but it makes a brave attempt. This ranges from call-and-response courtesy of well-known Quebecois bands La Bottine Souriante ([[ASIN:B00005RVRV Anthologie]]) and Le Vent Du Nord ([[ASIN:B0000AISXV Maudite Moisson !]])to more modern fusion stylings from DobaCaracol, a track from Annie Villeneuve ([[ASIN:B0007IDUK2 Quand Je Ferme Les Yeux]]), the winner of Quebec's version of Pop Idol, and a nod to Quebec's rich First Nations heritage (there are eleven tribes) from Florent Vollant.<br /><br />I wasn't familiar with many of the artists (it's been six years since I lived in Quebec City), but I could think of many Quebecois artists that I wish had been included, such as Lhasa ([[ASIN:B000009MV1 La Llorona]]), whose haunting voice blends Spanish, English and French with a fusion of Mexican and world influences, early important pop figures such as Felix Leclerc ([[ASIN:B000FVHKFC 20th Century Masters]]) or Gilles Vigneault, or modern sensations such as Celine Dion ([[ASIN:B000CDSS1S On Ne Change Pas]]), Garou ([[ASIN:B0001ZA16M Reviens]]), Roch Voisine ([[ASIN:B000P6RB42 Roch: Best of Roch Voisine]]), Eric Lapointe, etc. My personal favorites are the two most traditional tracks from La Bottine Souriante and Le Vent Du Nord (I have a large collection of traditional Quebecois folk music) and the haunting track sung in Montagnais by Florent Vollant; his solo CDs ([[ASIN:B0000DI80G Katak]]) are sung entirely in Montagnais (an Algonquin language) and are absolutely amazing, though pricey for those of us south of the (Canadian) border.<br /><br />But these tantalizing tracks are an accurate reflection of the many cultural influences at work in Quebec, from First Nations tribes to its many Francophone immigrants from Africa and abroad, and Putumayo: Quebec serves as a perfect jumping-off point for a more in-depth exploration of the riches that Quebec's music has to offer.",[],B00187PNBU,B00187PNBU,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-08-05 10:32:37.000,16,False,One of the best I’ve seen!
5.0,An old-fashioned Christmas with Frankie,"Christmas Songs by Sinatra is a compilation of Christmas songs recorded by Frankie during the '40s and released as a series of 78s. With lush arrangements by Frankie's Columbia mainstay Axel Stordahl, these fifteen songs capture a Sinatra slowly evolving from ""boy singer"" with Harry James in 1939 and with Tommy Dorsey in 1940-42 to confident swinger by the early 1950s shortly before Sinatra left Columbia for Capitol (the tracks were recorded between '44 and '50).<br /><br />Opening the set is a slow, mellow cover of ""White Christmas,"" made famous by Bing Crosby in Holiday Inn. To be fair, Frankie's version is fairly similar, buoyed by the Bobby Tucker Singers. Next up is Silent Night, with a soft, haunting bell introduction. The Ken Lane singers provide a very soft harmony to Frankie's melody. This is one of the more beautiful vintage versions of Silent Night that I've heard; Axel's sweeping string bridge is unmistakably cinematic in only the way that the 1940s could be.<br />Adestes Fidelis sounds almost identical in arrangement to the first two songs.<br /><br />But Jingle Bells shakes things up; not as much as Bing and the Andrews Sisters (this version is a tad slower), but it's still a pleasant change of pace from the seriousness of the first three tracks. Other notable tracks include Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, Christmas Dreaming, and the brassy, bold Santa Claus is Coming To Town from 1947. This is the first track where Frankie's really swaggering; there's strong hints of his future swinger status on display. Let It Snow is also brassy and assertive, where the earlier tracks were soft, reverent and string-drenched. Here, muted trumpets and bass provide a rhythmic, lively backdrop for Sinatra. This track most clearly foreshadows Frank's work on Capitol and Reprise, and is the latest of the tracks, from 1950.<br /><br />Overall, Christmas Songs by Sinatra is a pleasant throwback to a simpler era, full of familiar Christmas tunes and a few surprises such as Christmas Dreaming (which I wasn't familiar with). The arrangements are in that 1940s style: string-drenched, with earnest-sounding female backup singers. The songs from the WWII era reflect on the values of family and faith, evident in religious songs such as Schubert's Ave Maria and the Lord's Prayer in addition to Silent Night and Adeste Fideles. Several of the tracks suffer from Axel's sameness in arrangement, but this is beautiful background music for a quiet Christmas season evening spent around a fireplace, or sitting in the hushed glow of the Christmas tree. Collector's of Frankie's Columbia works will want to add this to their collection. If you're a fan of Frank's later work on Capitol and Reprise, Frank rerecorded most of these songs at a later point (many are on A Jolly Christmas with Frank Sinatra).  If you're tired of the latest tween music ""sensation"" covering Muzak-lite versions of traditional carols, consider returning to the basics with a young Sinatra.",[],B0002S94F2,B0002S94F2,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-08-20 00:08:47.000,5,False,A veddy good time In Injah with the Brits!
4.0,A near-perfect compilation with most of the Motown greats,"Motown 40 collects some of Motown's greatest hits in honor of the label's 40th anniversary. The brainchild of Berry Gordy, Motown was originally christened Tamla Records in 1959. The first two tracks, Please Mr. Postman by the Marvelettes and Shop Around by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, were both early #1 hits, and the string of memorable hits continues with Heat Wave (in my opinion, the best Motown song ever), My Guy, Sugar Pie Honey Bunch, ABC, Stop! In the Name of Love, Someday We'll Be Together, Ma Cherie Amour, Tears of a Clown, What's Going On, and Dancing In the Street.<br /><br />Motown's powerhouse songwriting team of Holland-Dozier-Holland left the label in 1967 over royalty disputes and the label relocated from Detroit to Los Angeles in 1972. The hits tapered off, although they still owned several successful groups like the Commodores, Lionel Richie, Rick James, Teena Marie, Boyz II Men and DeBarge. The second disc of Motown 40 reflects this transitional period; I found it to be more inconsistent, and these songs haven't aged as well as those on the first disc. I loved the inclusion of Diana Ross's gay anthem I'm Coming Out (supposedly inspired when the song's author encountered a Diana Ross impersonator in a men's restroom), Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On, and Jermaine Jackson's Let's Get Serious. I would have preferred to see DeBarge's Rhythm of the Night. I liked the inclusion of Rockwell's Someone Is Watching Me; (with a cameo by Michael Jackson) it brought back memories of watching the Disney TV cartoon music video as a kid. The Puff Daddy (sorry, P. Diddy) remix of the Jackson 5's I Want You Back was utterly forgettable; if that's what it takes to sell Motown these days, then let classic Motown rest in peace.<br /><br />If you're new to the Motown catalog, this is a good starting point, with enough familiar hits from Motown's Hitsville USA heyday to satisfy casual fans. For the serious collector, you're better off bypassing this and snapping up Hip-o Select's reissues of the Complete Motown Singles, featuring every A- and B-side from 1959-1970 (there are currently 10 box sets).",[],B000001AO8,B000001AO8,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-09-14 11:55:43.000,0,False,"Gripping, dangerous, creepy!"
3.0,"A mixed bag...the Puppini Sisters step out, at the loss of their retro roots","The Puppini Sisters, inspired by the [[ASIN:B000168ACI The Triplets of Belleville]] from the Belgian/Quebecois animated film of the same name, pay homage to the girl groups of the 1930s and 1940s; from their victory curls to the fire engine red lipstick to the curvy, form-fitting retro dresses, here are three gals who are seriously enamored with WWII-era vocal music. Their tight harmonies and covers of retro gems such as Bei Mir Bist Du Shoen, Mr. Sandman, Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy and In The Mood fused seamlessly with covers of Kate Bush's Wuthering Heights, Blondie's Heart of Glass and Gloria Gaynor's anthem I Will Survive made their debut Betcha Bottom Dollar endearing and quirky, but with definite staying power, particularly if you're like me and you adore the Andrews Sisters.<br /><br />On their sophomore follow-up The Rise and Fall Of Ruby Woo, the trio (Marcella Puppini, Stephanie O'Brien, and Kate Mullins) have penned nearly half of the songs (Soho Nights, I Can't Believe I'm Not A Millionaire, Jilted, It's Not Over, And She Sang). The covers this time around are more zany, including the Bangles' Walk Like An Egyptianand Beyonce's Crazy in Love, along with Old Cape Cod and Spooky. The only nod to vintage covers here is It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing). But even here, the ""sisters"" have veered from strict 1940s harmony to taking liberties with scat singing, ad lib lyrics and drastically altering the tempo.<br /><br />Those who loved the Puppini Sisters' debut for its adherence to 1940s glamour and sonic fidelity will be sorely disappointed, particularly by some of the new songs like Jilted: ""Oh, trust the Cosmo quiz for advice,"" or I Can't Believe I'm Not A Millionaire, which features the line ""I fixed myself a Pop-Tart."" The 1940s this is not, but the new direction towards self-penned independence and less reliance on covers feels weak compared to their first album. Soho Nights was a standout, but I found myself routinely skipping over the other tracks written by the group.<br /><br />Overall, this is still a fun album with a nod to retro glam in the spirit of the Andrews Sisters, but the new songs paled next to the enduring classics from the 1940s and 1950s; the covers on this album were all from the last 20 years for the most part, which was a big leap from their prior album. The Puppini Sisters also recently released two songs for the Kitt Kittridge: An American Girl soundtrack that sound most similar to their debut, and I look forward to seeing what the future will hold for this unusual group.",[],B000WC45SE,B000WC45SE,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-09-14 12:10:20.000,7,False,Get to know all 50 states...
5.0,Romantic (and nostalgic),"""Beauty and the Beast"" was one of the earliest TV shows I remember watching as a child (next to ""the Cosby Show""). At the time, I was too young to appreciate any of the show's deeper musings on love and attraction and the ills of modern society; I was simply drawn by Ron Perlman's amazing makeup and smooth delivery that seemed full of classical theater. As an adult, I purchased the first two seasons of Beauty and the Beast and tracked down the rerelease of the original Lee Holdridge CD Of Love and Hope.<br /><br />Vincent, the man-lion title character on the show, frequently recites classical poetry to his love Catherine, including works by Shakespeare, Frost, Rilke, Poe, and Byron. Perlman's delivery (complete with dental prosthetics so that his sound as Vincent would be consistent from show to CD) is purely classical, full of rich inflection and sensuality. This CD includes readings of ""She walks in beauty,"" ""I arise from the dreams of thee,"" ""Sonnets,"" ""Letters to a young poet,"" and ""To cast all else aside"" set to music from the show (the music is played softly behind the poetry). There are also several original pieces of score by Lee Holdridge, including the main titles, Laura's theme, Margaret's theme, and Catherine's lullaby, and vocals by Lisa Angelle on the love song ""The First Time I Loved Forever."" The original score by Holdridge is low-key, with lush strings and woodwinds.<br /><br />Fans will love reliving Vincent's poetic serenades to Catherine; I never grow tired of Perlman-as-Vincent's velvety recitations. Truthfully, I can't see this having much appeal outside of fans of the show, but if you enjoy moving interpretations of classical poetry, you might also find much to enjoy in Ron Perlman's delivery. This is wonderfully relaxing played at the end of a stressful day; his voice is soothing, and the words immortal. The liner notes also include the text of the poems.",[],B000BLI3BG,B000BLI3BG,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-12-01 00:46:00.000,11,True,Determination in spades!  A great read!
4.0,A haunting debut that left me wanting more,"I was captivated by Beth Rowley's haunting ""Nobody's Fault But My Own"" on my way home from work (she was featured on NPR), and knew that I had to have more of her smokey, gospel blues-tinged debut Little Dreamer. Roughly half of the album has that hand-waving church vibe that makes you want to sway in place with your eyes closed, caught up in the power of the music. ""Only One Cloud"" is a moody song that sounds like a field spiritual. Jim Crawford's ""When the Rains Came"" is fronted by a haunting  Dobro with a driving bass that sounds like a Native American dance. ""Almost Persuaded"" tells the tale of ""temptation flowing like wine."" The chorus of ""You Never Called Me Tonight"" has production values that sound like it could have come out of some lost Motown vault, with a sassy, almost funeral-like pounding piano knelling the death of the doomed relationship.<br /><br />But Little Dreamer is multifaceted, and includes covers of Bob Dylan (I Shall Be Released) and Willie Nelson (Angel Flying Too Close To The Ground), along with some upbeat pop. The sweet, slow piano intro to ""Sweet Hours"" almost sounds like a lost Norah Jones gem as bass and snare step in to pick up the beat, while ""So Sublime"" flirts with hints of 1960s folk and pop. I wasn't as crazy about ""Angel""; Beth's voice wasn't as complementary to the song as on the stronger gospel-influenced tracks.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very promising debut of another undeniably talented British singer-songwriter in the vein of [[ASIN:B000HBK3MM Corinne Bailey Rae]], [[ASIN:B000N2G3RY Back to Black]] and [[ASIN:B000XGDO04 19]] who truly inhabits the smoky, gospel-tinged blues tunes and makes them her own.",[],B001AVTLG2,B001AVTLG2,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2008-12-04 00:32:55.000,2,False,Disappointing...

5.0,Songs to lift the spirit,"I first heard about the Priests last summer; CNN dubbed them ""New Clergymen on the Block."" Father Eugene O'Hagan, Father Martin O'Hagan (the two are brothers) and their childhood friend Father David Delargy are priests in the parishes of Ballyclare and Ballygowan, Cushendun, and Hannahstown in Northern Ireland. All three studied at the Irish College in Rome, and sang for Pope John Paul II as they studied for the priesthood. They were recently signed by SonyBMG in a much-publicized deal valued at one million pounds; their contract also has unique stipulations such that their respective parish duties take precedence over promotional events, or that they may opt out of any performance or commercial activity which conflicts with their religious beliefs.<br /><br />Despite the proliferation of classical crossover groups and soloists, the Priests are unique. ""Their brand isn't something that's been invented; it's been around for 2,000 years,"" says Samantha Wright, the group's manager. A portion of the proceeds go to charity. Both the concept,  talented singers who also happen to be ordained priests, and the fact that the proceeds go to charity, is a refreshing change in this age of contrived commercially-oriented classical crossover acts such as Il Divo and Amici Forever.<br /><br />The fourteen songs include sacred Latin hymns such as Ave Maria, Panis Angelicus, Ecce Sacerdos Magnus, and Domine Fili Unigente (from Vivaldi's Gloria) and Haydn's Mit Würd und Hoheit Angetan, in addition to more modern tracks such as Andrew Lloyd Webber's haunting Pie Jesu (originally sung by Sarah Brightman) and Benedictus. There are two Spanish tracks and several Irish compositions, including Ag Criost An Siol and a musical setting of the familiar Irish Blessing (""May the road rise to meet you...""). Although the album is not Christmas-themed, there is a beautiful, uptempo version of ""O Holy Night"" in which the harmony of the three priests is woven together most magically over the shimmer of horns.<br /><br />The production values are simple and understated, allowing the beauty of the songs (and of the priests' divinely gifted voices) to shine through.  The beauty of the singing has nothing to do with studio wizardry or posturing; there are no glaring synthesizers or technical sleight of hand as is omnipresent in classical crossover albums these days. The music is simply a vehicle for prayer, backed sublimely by the Choir of Philharmonic Academy of Rome and recorded in St. Peter's Basilica. The Priests themselves said it best: ""When we sing, we don't simply sing. We pray.""<br /><br />The Priests is a work that can be appreciated on many levels whether you choose to enjoy it simply as soothing background music or as a deeper tool to aid in reflection and prayer, and its various elements come together flawlessly, from the three mesmerizing voices of Fathers Eugene, Martin, and David, to the timeless hymns and songs selected, to the traditional philharmonic arrangements and backing choir.  This is a gift that will certainly be cherished by those who love sacred music (Catholics will feel right at home with several of the more traditional hymns like Ave Maria and Panis Angelicus), Irish music (there are hints of tin whistle and a touch of Irish Gaelic on Ag Criost An Siol and Irish Blessing) and by anyone who appreciates musical beauty.",[],B001DAYA6Q,B001DAYA6Q,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2009-01-02 04:39:12.000,20,False,Best read after the previous novels in the series...
4.0,A fine return to form on Tiziano's fourth album,"After being madly smitten by Tiziano's stellar debut [[ASIN:B0000665EN Rosso Relativo]] and his sophomore follow-up [[ASIN:B000777IBK 111 Centoundici]], I was underwhelmed by his third album [[ASIN:B000FTWACM Nessuno &egrave; Solo]]. That all changed when I heard the early positive reviews of Alla Mia Eta, which was released in Italy in November 2008.<br /><br />The thirteen songs (twelve originals and one bonus English-language translation starring a duet with Kelly Rowland) are a mix of ballads, a smattering of hip hop, and uptempo. Indietro / Breathe Gentle is strongly influenced by R&B, while Il Tempo Stesso is a nod to the 1980s. La Traversata Dell'Estate opens with a mesmerizing horn section that morphs into synth-heavy vocal acrobatics reminiscent of his first album. Per UN po' SPARIR&Ograve; is the purest nod to Tiziano's rapid-fire rhyme from earlier tracks such as Rosso Relativo (and the opening police sirens practically caused me to pull over while merging on the highway...it freaks me out every time!).<br /><br />Tiziano is clearly moving towards ballads and away from his earlier roots in R&B and hip hop as seen on his first two albums. However, his lyrics and music are evocative and have the smooth flow of poetry. If I had to sum up the mood it would be pensive and bittersweet; there are layers of hurt here under the sweet sounding chords or punchy tempos. I still can't say that I love this more than Rosso Relativo, which I discovered while living in Spain in 2002, but it's definitely growing on me. The Spanish version is also available, but I prefer to listen to the songs in the original Italian (A Mi Edad also features a duet with the Mexican group RBD).<br /><br />Note: I have the original Italian CD, and there are NOT fourteen tracks as listed: there is no acoustic remix of Alla Mia Eta (although it can be purchased from iTunes Italy if you have an Italian credit card). The last track is the English version of Indietro with Tiziano and Kelly Rowland (Kelly even sings a few lines in Italian at the end). The CD is also equipped with Opendisc, where you can access several Tiziano wallpapers, music videos, and live performances.",[],B001IQDAXY,B001IQDAXY,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2009-03-11 01:41:04.000,4,False,A must if you plan to grow lavender...
5.0,Motown's pinnacle: The Sound of Young America delivers in style,"1966 may have been Motown's greatest year: 75% of its singles charted, with 22 in the Top Ten and three Number Ones. The familiar roster of the Temptations, Four Tops, Martha Reeves and Vandellas, the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and Smokey Robinson are all here, along with gems by the Spinners, Contours, Monitors, and Elgins. There's an appearance by the short-lived Mynah Birds, featuring then-unknowns Neil Young and Rick James. Their single, It's My Time and Go On And Cry, catalog number V.I.P. 25033, was withdrawn shortly prior to its release due to to the fact that their manager took their advance, and when the band complained, he turned in Rick James for being AWOL from the Navy. This is the first time that these rare singles have seen the light of day, and it's a sure bet that Neil Young fans will want to add this to their collection.<br /><br />The sixth volume in Hip-O-Select's massive 12-box set of complete Motown singles, the 125 tracks are arranged in chronological order by A-side and B-side. Like the other Complete Motown Singles, the box features an actual reproduction 45 RPM single of that year's smash single, the Four Tops' Reach Out I'll Be There b/w Until You Love Someone. The Holy Trinity of Holland-Dozier-Holland ([[ASIN:B0009S2TIY Heaven Must Have Sent You: The Holland/Dozier/Holland Story]]), house band the Funk Brothers([[ASIN:B00008J2HC Standing In The Shadows of Motown]], [[ASIN:B00021LPLA Standing in the Shadows of Motown: Deluxe Edition]]), and the woefully-underappreciated backup singers the Andantes (Jackie Hicks, Marlene Barrow, and Louvain Demps) add the signature Motown sound to every track.<br /><br />1966 saw Jr. Walker, who burst onto the scene with Shotgun in 1965, trying to reprise his success with Roadrunner and Shoot Your Shot (he also covers Barrett Strong's first smash hit Money (That's What I Want). The Supremes struck gold with You Keep Me Hanging On and You Can't Hurry Love. Martha and the Vandellas hit back with the captivating I'm Ready for Love, and the Elgins served up the beautiful doo-wop-infused ballad Heaven Must Have Sent You (no relation to Heaven Must Have Sent You From Above). Marvin Gaye rocks the soulful It Takes Two with Kim Weston and Little Darlin', skillfully aided by the aforementioned Andantes. The Monitors turned out an amazing cover of the Valadiers' 1961 Greetings (This is Uncle Sam), a song which took on profound new poignancy in 1966 as thousands of young men would soon enter boot camp in preparation for Vietnam. The Isley Brothers, long relegated to cover tunes and what they accused were ""leftovers"" by Smokey Robinson and Holland-Dozier-Holland, had the chance to shine with This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You), a smash hit they later reprised with Rod Stewart in 1989 ([[ASIN:B001DMJAMI The Definitive Rod Stewart (2 CD)]]). The Four Tops mesmerize on Reach Out (I'll Be There) and Standing in the Shadows of Love, while the Temptations steal the show with Get Ready, Ain't Too Proud To Beg (backed by the incredible B-side You'll Lose a Precious Love). Kim Weston turns out a powerhouse performance on Helpless, with possibly the greatest Holland-Dozier-Holland line ever: ""my heart feels much abusion"" (yes, it's actually a word, but they seriously lucked out in finding a rhyme for ""confusion"" and ""solution"").<br /><br />The book contains 112 pages of track-by-track liner notes by Stu Hackel, Bill Dahl, Keith Hughes, and Harry Weinger. There are also rare photos sure to please the most rabid of Motown fans. Like the other Hip-O-Select Complete Motown Singles box sets, this is a limited edition limited to 6,000 copies, and is sold out at many retailers; you can find a copy, it's a surefire investment. This truly may be the greatest year in the label's history; after 1966, Holland-Dozier-Holland and several artists such as the Isley Brothers and Kim Weston departed the Motown label (and Martha and the Vandellas never scored a Top Ten single after 1967). This is Motown in its prime, and a worthy tribute to the talent and promise that Detroit held forty years ago.",[],B000JRYNWK,B000JRYNWK,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2009-04-05 02:09:48.000,3,False,Required reading - this is the whole reading experience!
4.0,Add some sunshine to your day...,"Natasha Bedingfield's sophomore album Pocketful of Sunshine builds on her strong debut [[ASIN:B000CD0P8M Unwritten]], blending R&B with pop ballads and slick production. Opening with the upbeat ""Put Your Arms Around Me,"" the second track is the standout single (the music video is captivating as well) ""Pocketful of Sunshine,"" followed by the Caribbean-kissed ""Happy."" Natasha slides firmly into R&B territory on ""Love Like This"" with Sean Kingston. ""Angel"" was another track that I fell in love with; the guitar intro reminded me of Portuguese fado. ""Backyard"" is a really interesting song that took me a couple of listens to warm up to; the unusual chorus waxes nostalgic along clear gender lines: ""your lasso, my tiara, my wand, your plastic bazooka."" Many of the tracks are heavily influenced by R&B and hip hop, and these are the strongest ones in my opinion. Pocketful of Sunshine is definitely worth a listen, and it's a real pleasure to see Natasha's songwriting mature.",[],B000Y14U4M,B000Y14U4M,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2009-06-01 01:16:04.000,1,False,Decided to wait until grandchildren are older...
4.0,Crossing my fingers for Hikki's crossover success,"I first heard of Hikaru Utada from her Kingdom Hearts contribution Simple and Clean and a remix of Automatic. Our local library had a copy of her Japanese-language CD [[ASIN:B00005HV8J Distance]], and I was hooked. Hikaru (nicknamed Hikki by her fans) has sold over 30 million albums worldwide, and despite several English releases ([[ASIN:B00000JAXQ Precious]] and [[ASIN:B0002ZYE3M Exodus]]), she's yet to attain crossover success in the US. I'd heard about her 2004 English-language release [[ASIN:B0002ZYE3M Exodus]], which was too scattered to be a commercial success in the States, and was excited to see This is the One.  I'm normally not an impulse buyer, but after hearing the haunting Come Back To Me, I rushed out to snatch up a copy.<br /><br />As the opening track and first single from the album, Come Back To Me holds its own as a power R&B ballad that could have been Beyonce's. Opening with a dramatic minor-key piano glissando, the piano stays in the background as Hikki dissects a sad tale of infidelity and pleads for a second chance. Me Muero has a quirky Latin (Brazilian?) vibe throughout, and Ryuchi Sakamoto's Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence makes an appearance as well.<br /><br />My favorite track is Taking My Money Back, about a wronged woman who wants her money and her time back from a cheating boyfriend. Dirty Desire finds Hikki going in rather lewd directions (""during my 9 to 5, I'm thinking 6 and 9"").  I was lukewarm on Automatic Part 2; it doesn't hold a candle to the original version and its remixes. On and On was another standout track with remix / club potential, although the looped ""Yeah"" in the background was annoying. The three bonus tracks are Simple and Clean, and Sanctuary (opening and closing).<br /><br />This isn't my favorite Hikki CD, but there's a lot of potential for her to finally reach American airwaves. There are several strong tracks here, and her English lyrics seem stronger than on 2004's Exodus. Hikki's crystal soprano soars. If you're a fan of Hikaru Utada or just plain R&B, This is the One is worth a listen.",[],B0026LYM8C,B0026LYM8C,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2009-06-07 16:30:54.000,0,False,A more humane Evan Smoak...
5.0,"Smoky, soulful sensation","Melody Gardot's music is as haunting as her own story. Nearly killed in a hit-and-run accident at 19, she suffered aphasia, memory loss, hypersensitivity to light and sound and nerve damage. Her doctor encouraged her to try music therapy, and Melody penned her first songs, resulting in 2005's EP Some Lessons: The Bedroom Sessions, so named because they were recorded with Melody sitting in a wheelchair at the hospital. She played piano prior to her accident, but because of the nerve damage from her fractured pelvis, she couldn't sit at a piano, so she picked up a guitar.<br /><br />The same DJ that promoted a young Norah Jones also picked up Melody Gardot, and she was signed to Verve, resulting in her first album Worrisome Heart (which features one song off the EP, Some Lessons, the first song that Melody wrote after her accident). The album opens with the smoky, noir-drenched Worrisome Heart, with its blusey piano intro and snare brushes. The brass section adds punch, while the Harmon-muted trumpet adds a striking counterpart.<br /><br />All That I Need Is Love opens with guitar and clarinet, with whimsical lyrics and playful delivery that segues into some upbeat scat singing. Sweet Memories will draw the most comparisons to Norah Jones ([[ASIN:B00005YW4H Come Away with Me]]), with its soft blend of folksy acoustic guitar and Dobro guitar. Some Lessons tells Melody's difficult story; she said that she's refrained from performing it live because of the painful connotations. Quiet Fire has a dark, smoky vibe from the organ. One Day opens with the Harmon muted trumpet and the simple simplicity of guitar. Love Me Like a River Does may be the haunting showpiece that calls to mind Billie Holiday; the raw, wistful yearning with its undercurrent of piano. The playful, pouty bounce of Goodnight is addictive, with its scat and layered vocals. The album is short, though; it clocks in at less than 40 minutes, leaving you craving more (Melody's second album is [[ASIN:B001NESPHC My One and Only Thrill]]).<br /><br />If Film Noir could be condensed into a single package, it would be Worrisome Heart. This music would be amazing on its own, but is even more powerful for Melody's experiences recovering from a near-fatal accident and turning it into powerful jazz-infused tunes that showcase her smoky, mature voice. This is a must for fans of Norah Jones and Madeleine Peyroux, and classic jazz chanteuses like Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald.",[],B000WTNCYA,B000WTNCYA,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2009-06-13 13:04:17.000,0,False,Just a great guide for growing vegetables...
4.0,Electrifying blend of classical and modern,"Wunderkind David Garrett grew up in Aachen, Germany and studied violin under Ida Haendel and Itzhak Perlman before graduating from Juilliard in 2004. As a child prodigy, he was subjected to a grueling rehearsal schedule of classical repertoire (he injured his back and shoulders recording [[ASIN:B0000012Z7 Paganini: Caprices]] as a teen), but the freedom of NYC (including the huge music library at Juilliard and various clubs) opened up a new world of musical possibilities. David supplemented his income by modeling for print magazines like Vogue and Fashion Week for Armani while at Juilliard; his striking looks and broad crossover appeal have earned him the nickname ""the David Beckham of classical music."" Garrett's response?  ""He kind of drew a new audience to football, OK mostly female, but that's not a bad thing. I think that's why people actually say that because they know I really try very hard to get new audiences for classical music.""<br /><br />I first heard of David Garrett in a Barnes and Noble and was hooked. After watching numerous clips and interviews (both German and English) on YouTube, I was blown away by his utter confidence and poise. You can see at once that this is someone who truly loves music and his instrument (he plays both a 1717 Stradivarius and a 1772 Guadagnini, which he badly damaged after falling on it); just like growing up bilingually with a German father and American mother, he's equally at home as ambassador of classical and pop.<br /><br />""David Garrett"" is actually David's fourth solo album for Decca after [[ASIN:B000NJWSE4 Free]], [[ASIN:B0010NX274 Virtuoso]], and Encore, and most of the tracks are pulled from these three albums (I would have liked to see the inclusion of ""Claire de Lune"" from Encore). The themes run the gamut from Baroque (Vivaldi's ""Summer"" from the Four Seasons, Bach's ""Air"") to Romantic (Bizet's ""Carmen Fantasie""), a dash of Italian Gypsy, modern rock (Metallica, Queen, AC/DC, Michael Jackson), film scores (Zorba the Greek, Pirates of the Caribbean), and original works (""Chelsea Girl,"" ""Rock Prelude""). The album opens with a high-octane rendition of Vivaldi that might bring to mind Vanessa-Mae or perhaps the eccentric Nigel Kennedy, but David makes this all his own, and at breakneck speed.<br /><br />My favorites are the uptempo tracks, particularly the ""He's a Pirate"" theme from Pirates of the Caribbean. This Hans Zimmer gem is a cross between sweeping score reminiscent of the Chieftains' score for TNT's ""Treasure Island"" with the stately delicacy of a bourrée. The xylophone echoes the violin, accented by triangle and harp. The intense ""Smooth Criminal"" opens with tympani mimicking a heartbeat...chilling and effective. David's aggressive bowing in the first part slides into a near-human wail as he duets with the electric guitar, then returns to the staccato melody. Queen and AC/DC are given similarly effective treatment. Bill Withers' ""Ain't No Sunshine"" also translates well to the violin medium, buoyed by the assertive piano bassline. I loved the rollicking ""Zorba's Dance"" but was a little underwhelmed by ""Dueling Strings"" (I just can't distance the song from [[ASIN:B000RTB0R6 Deliverance (Deluxe Edition)]]).<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun, flashy album that showcases David's immense technical talent and will hopefully attract younger listeners to classical repertoire. Purists will likely not be impressed, but for casual listeners, this is a catchy album that does justice to familiar tunes (hey, if it gets today's youth interested in Bach and Vivaldi, that's a good thing).

5.0,"I prefer this to 2009's ""David Garrett"" North American release","I first heard of violin prodigy David Garrett in a Barnes and Noble in-store play, and picked up his eponymous (US) debut [[ASIN:B001UW58WW David Garrett]]. However, I felt that the North American version, which was cobbled together from 2007's ""Virtuoso"" and 2008's ""Encore,"" was a tad short. I went searching for other Garrett recordings only to discover that they're only available as super-expensive imports. After comparing tracklistings on Free, Virtuoso and Encore, I decided on the version of Virtuoso that has Pachelbel's Canon in D (the other pressing does not). Many of the tracks are also on ""David Garrett"" (Carmen, Nothing Else Matters, Csardas, Duelling Banjos), but there are other superb additions such as Morricone's ""La Califfa,"" Paganini's Rhapsody (best known from Andrew Lloyd Webber's divine [[ASIN:B000002PBV Variations]]), Bernstein's ""Somewhere,"" Rimsky-Korsakov's ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" (for which David set a Guinness World Record for fastest performance on live TV at 66 seconds, or 13 notes per second), Secret Garden's ""You Raise Me Up"" (check out the stunning original by Irish singer Brian Kennedy, NOT Josh Groban, on [[ASIN:B001NTUELW You Raise Me Up]]), and three original compositions, ""Serenade,"" ""Toccata,"" and ""Eliza's Song.""<br /><br />Opening with La Califfa (of which Sarah Brightman did a stunning cover of on [[ASIN:B00004UDNP La Luna]]), there is much more of a classical crossover vibe on Virtuoso rather than a rock feel per the North American update (which featured AC/DC, Metallica, Queen and Michael Jackson). The next four tracks are the same versions on ""David Garrett""; Csardas is particularly good and brings to mind Brahms' Hungarian Dance Number 5 (the bonus track is a chillout version of Csardas that's got a Nuevo Flamenco vibe in the last third of the song). ""Pachelbel's Canon"" is a pleasing update on this Baroque gem that manages to be traditional and modern at the same time; the intro stays fairly close to the score, then David gently and deftly takes the song into new directions (if you like [[ASIN:B001235DTW Christmas Canon]], you'll love David's cover or vice versa).<br /><br />""Paganini's Rhapsody"" was an interesting experiment. I grew up listening to Julian Lloyd Webber's version of [[ASIN:B000V9G0PO Variations - Variations I-IV]] and it was a treat to hear this on violin (David's full version, recorded when he was a teenager, is available at [[ASIN:B0000012Z7 Paganini: Caprices]]). Again, David sticks to the score for the first few measures, then branches out. There's some interesting use of acoustic guitar providing a forceful strummed bassline and percussion (tambourine, xylophone, bells). This one is technically challenging and gorgeous; it almost sounds like the score to Danny Elfman's [[ASIN:B000IFRQHC Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas]] in places.<br /><br />""The Flight of the Bumblebee"" is also played at breakneck speed (1:20), showcasing David's technical prowess at super-fast fingering yet maintaining clarity of tone. The original tracks ""Serenade"" and ""Eliza's Song"" are soft and romantic in a bittersweet way (according to the liner notes, ""Serenade"" was inspired by unrequited love on David's part). The hard-rocking ""Toccata"" sounds like Bach on Red Bull with an espresso chaser. This one must be impressive in concert...I can picture strobe lights flashing to the driving melody and electric guitar riffs. ""You Raise Me Up"" takes Virtuoso back into calmer waters (I would LOVE to hear David record/perform this with Brian Kennedy on vocals...that would be a dream team), finishing up with ""Eliza's Song."" The bonus mix of Csardas is almost identical to the album version except for the last minute or so.<br /><br />So is ""Virtuoso"" worth the hefty import price? After all, it costs many times more than David's North American debut. For me, I found ""Virtuoso"" to be more rewarding as I appreciated the classical covers more. The tracks seemed stronger overall, and I really enjoyed ""Canon,"" ""Paganini's Rhapsody,"" and ""Flight of the Bumblebee."" If you're a rock fan, you'll likely find [[ASIN:B001UW58WW David Garrett]] more rewarding, as it features covers of Michael Jackson's ""Smooth Criminal,"" AC/DC's ""Thunderstruck,"" the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" theme, and Queen's ""Who Wants to Live Forever?""

5.0,Beautiful introduction to the violin's versatility in the hands of a prodigy,"""Pure Classics"" contains selections from David Garrett's Deutsche Grammophon recordings from 1995-2001: Mozart's Violin Concertos (1995), Bach's Partita in D-Minor (1995), Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto (2001), and 1997's [[ASIN:B0000012Z7 Paganini: Caprices]], as well as tracks by Beethoven and Conus. My only complaint is that pieces are not grouped by composer; Paganini gets the lion's share with six tracks devoted to his Variations, and these are scattered across the second half of the disc (however, Variations 1, 4, and 9 are sequential). This is a lovely overview of David's prodigious talent as a teen when he recorded these tracks, particularly the technically demanding Variations (Paganini did much to expand violin techniques). The repertoire choices are solid and David's technical mastery impeccable. His early Deutsche Grammophon  recordings are out of print in the US, so this is a reasonably-priced introduction to his purely classical repertoire (David rerecorded Paganini's Variation 24 in A minor, better known from Andrew Lloyd Webber's [[ASIN:B000V9G0PO Variations - Variations I-IV]] on [[ASIN:B0010NX274 Virtuoso]]).",[],B000079BGM,B000079BGM,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2009-08-09 02:31:34.000,39,True,Unputdownable!
5.0,Your own floating tropical paradise,"Lagoon was German ambient composer Nik Tyndall's first (and only) release on the Hearts of Space label in 1990. Tyndall was originally a designer of sound units and amplifiers in the 1970s, and soon after delved into composing for electronic instruments. He released several ambient albums on the German label Sky during the 1980's. Like Tyndall's other works (he's still composing for New Earth Records, mostly Reiki music), Lagoon is rich with layers of organic sound that evoke water, windchimes, gongs, and gamelan to create the sensation of a floating paradise. The seven tracks flow smoothly into one another, creating a soothing tropical paradise. Lagoon is probably my favorite CD of all time; I listened to it nonstop for several years in the middle of my dolphin / marine biologist phase when I was obsessed with the Australian TV show [[ASIN:B000LQISG6 Ocean Girl - First Season 2-DVD Set ( Ocean Odyssey ) ( Ocean Girl - Season 1 ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.0 Import - Australia ]]] (the Ocean Girl soundtrack by Garry McDonald and Lawrence Stone is a dead ringer for Lagoon). There's also a track from the CD-ROM game Riven ([[ASIN:B002CEQG1O Survey Island Theme]]) that reminds me strongly of Lagoon.

4.0,"A strongly classical repertoire delights on ""Harmony""","On The Priests' sophomore CD, Fathers Martin and Eugene O'Hagan and Father David Delargy tackle another round of soul-stirring hymns and religious music, including How Great Thou Art, Amazing Grace, the Lord's Prayer and Silent Night. The Lord's Prayer deserves special mention for the powerful a capella rendition; it's the only track not backed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, thereby evoking the power and grace of early plainchant. The English-language version of Silent Night opens and closes with a tin whistle and is more traditionally paced than the uptempo version of ""O Holy Night"" from their debut. The fathers composed the music for ""King of Kings"" themselves. Nods to their Irish Catholic heritage come in the form of Gaelic Blessing by John Rutter and the lovely Irish Gaelic hymn Bi Iosa Im Chroise (Christ Be In My Heart).<br /><br />The strongest tracks are those from the Baroque / Classical / Romantic repertoire, including Stozel (Bist du Bei Mir, frequently misattributed to Bach), Pergolesi (Stabat Mater), Vivaldi (Laudamus Te), Mozart (Ave Verum Corpus), Haydn's Te Deum and Mendelssohn (Lift Thine Eyes). This version of Pergolesi's divine Stabat Mater is a bit more uptempo than some of the other versions I own by Andreas Scholl, Cecilia Bartoli and Sara Mingardo, but no less haunting. Much as on their debut, the orchestral backing complements the priests' rich voices without overwhelming, allowing the vocals to shine.<br /><br />Overall, ""Harmony"" has much more of a uniform feel than their debut; most noticeably, there are fewer foreign-language songs (""Priests"" had two Spanish songs in addition to Latin and Irish Gaelic tracks) and only one Christmas song. The fifteen tracks really shine in the hands of producer Mike Hedges, Fathers Martin and Eugene O'Hagan and Father David Delargy, the Royal Philharmonic, the Brompton Oratory School and Coro. In Father Eugene's words, `I think, because over the last year we have been singing together so much, our voices blend better and our sound has matured. There's an even greater sense of synergy with the voices, and we're more confident too. Even as a professional singer, you never stop fine-tuning the instrument.'

5.0,Stevie + covers of other Motown greats = pure genius,"Stevie Wonder's 1967 album ""I Was Made to Love Her"" was rushed out to capitalize on the success of the title track, but it's chock-full of rare Stevie soul covers by Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, Ray Charles, Bobby ""Blue"" Bland, and James Brown. Sadly, with the exception of one or two tracks, the other gems have gone out of print in CD and MP3 format with the exception of a couple of pricey Japanese pressings.<br /><br />Things start off with a bang on ""I Was Made to Love Her,"" which features Funk Brother James Jamerson on one of Motown's greatest bass riffs. To hear James's true greatness on this track, check out the Funk Brothers' instrumental version on [[ASIN:B00021LPLA Standing in the Shadows of Motown: Deluxe Edition]] (there was some heated debate whether the bass credit belonged to Carole Kaye or James Jamerson, but evidence points solidly to the latter). Next up is the Lloyd Price-penned ""Send Me Some Lovin',"" recorded by Little Richard in 1957, Sam Cooke in 1963 and Dean Martin in 1965. The second Wonder-penned song, ""I'd Cry,"" is classic Motown through and through, with the help of the Andantes.<br /><br />Stevie's rockin' cover of ""Respect"" gets a healthy dose of harp injected, while ""My Girl"" rivals the Temps' signature performance. ""Baby Don't You Do It"" nods to Marvin Gaye's 1964 Motown single, while Ray Charles ""I'm a Fool for You"" has a gospel vibe. Gaye makes a second appearance on ""Can I Get a Witness,"" while Bobby Bland's ""I Pity the Fool"" is a hardcore dose of blues (check out the blues guitar riffs!) uncommon in Motown...Stevie really shines on this track, and it's my favorite on the album. A young James Brown's ""Please, Please, Please"" does just that, and the album closes with the minor-key ""Every Time I See You I Go Wild"" (also available on [[ASIN:B000SFYZBM The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 7: 1967]] ; it was the B-side to ""I Was Made to Love Her.""<br /><br />Overall, this is Stevie in his Motown prime. The album is worth it for the inspired covers of other Motown acts and other soul artists like Otis Redding, Ray Charles and James Brown, and Stevie's three original tunes hold up well next to the established standards. Hopefully Motown will reissue this in the US with bonus tracks and great liner notes at some point in the future!",[],B0007ZJ3LA,B0007ZJ3LA,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2010-01-18 16:33:35.000,1,False,Great Twists
5.0,A thing of beauty...,"The Isley Brothers hit early success with 1959's ""Shout,"" a response to Jackie Wilson's ""Lonely Teardrops"" that ranks at #118 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time. The call-and-response chorus owed much to traditional gospel. O'Kelly Jr., Rudolph and Ronald Isley formed the Isley Brothers in 1954 and started out recording doo-wop in New York. In 1959, they signed with RCA Records; in 1962, they signed with Wand and scored their first Top 40 single with ""Twist & Shout."" In 1965, the group signed with Motown's Tamla imprint. 1966 saw the release of ""This Old Heart Of Mine (Is Weak For You),"" a Holland-Dozier-Holland gem that reached No. 12 on the Hot 100 and No. 6 in R&B (it was originally intended for the Supremes).  However, the Isley Brothers couldn't come up with a commercially successful follow-up, and complained of being given ""leftover"" tracks originally written for other Motown acts. The Isleys never really fit in with the spit-and-polish Motown promotional machine; in the words of a BBC reviewer,  the Isley Brothers ""were not cheerily going to visit the charm school and perform all the ditzy promotional routines that Motown expected of its roster."" They parted ways with Motown in 1968. Flash-forward two decades: in 1989, Ronald Isley and Rod Stewart released a Top 10 duet version of ""This Old Heart of Mine"" that reached #10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and spent five weeks at #1 on the US adult contemporary chart.<br /><br />It's true that the Isleys did record a large number of Motown cover songs by the Supremes, Valadiers/Monitors, etc., but that was common practice at the label (Stevie Wonder covered the Four Tops, Kim Weston covered the Supremes, David Ruffin covered the Jackson 5; see [[ASIN:B000BPI2AE Motown Sings Motown Treasures]] for more examples). They had a huge following in the UK with hits like ""Behind a Painted Smile"" and ""I Guess I'll Always Love You,"" and ended up touring England after their split from Motown. But as evidenced on this collection of 52 tracks, there were plenty of gems during their brief tenure at Hitsville USA: ""Put Yourself In My Place,"" ""Why When Love Is Gone,"" the soul-drenched ""Seek and You Shall Find,"" ""Take Some Time Out For Love,"" and the standout: beautiful, tender ""My Love Is Your Love Forever"" (Ronald Isley's tenor never sounded sweeter). Even their cover versions of the Supremes (""Stop! In the Name of Love,"" ""Nowhere to Run,"" ""I Hear a Symphony""), Elgins (""Put Yourself in My Place,"" which went to #13 in the UK) and Marvin Gaye (""Baby Don't You Do It"") add a fresh new sound to the originals. One of the more interesting tracks is ""Smile,"" the original version of ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted.""<br /><br />""Motown Anthology"" was released in England in 2009 in time for Motown's 50th anniversary. Unfortunately, it wasn't released in the US. There are several songs that are featured in both mono and stereo mixes (My Love Is Your Love Forever, Greetings (This Is Uncle Sam), Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While), Tell Me It's Just a Rumor, All Because I Love You, My Love Is Your Love, I Guess I'll Always Love You, This Old Heart of Mine). It's a must-have recording for classic Motown fans and anyone who appreciates well-crafted music (many of the tracks were penned by the holy trinity of Holland-Dozier-Holland).",[],B002L5R73K,B002L5R73K,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2010-05-29 16:12:37.000,11,True,"Rustic, hearty cuisine"
5.0,Awesome collection of soul from the 1960s - 1970s,"100 Soul Classics (not to be confused with [[ASIN:B0025X4ONE 100 Soul Classics]]) is a stellar collection of well-known soul hits from Stax, Motown, and Philly Soul labels. The various artists and labels are randomly scattered across the four discs.<br /><br />Motown is more than amply represented by Diana Ross (""Reflections""), Stevie Wonder (""My Cherie Amour""), The Four Tops (""I Can't Help Myself""), Smokey and the Miracles (""The Tracks of My Tears""), Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell (""Ain't No Mountain High Enough""), The Temptations (""Just My Imagination""), Jimmy Ruffin, The Velvelettes, Martha Reeves, Mary Wells (""My Guy""), Brenda Holloway (""Every Little Bit Hurts""), The Elgins (""Heaven Must Have Sent You""), Edwin Starr, and the Jackson 5. There are a total of 32 Motown tracks, including all the megahits like ""Heat Wave,"" ""ABC,"" ""My Guy, ""Sugar Pie Honey Bunch,"" etc., along with classics like the Elgins' ""Heaven Must Have Sent You"" and the Isley Brothers' ""This Old Heart of Mine Is Weak For You."" Junior Walker even makes a guest appearance.<br /><br />Post-Atlantic Stax (1968 and later) artists include the incomparable Otis Redding, Eddie Floyd, Isaac Hayes, Curtis Mayfield, Jean Knight, and the Staple Singers. Sam Cooke and James Brown also get several tracks. Philly Soul makes the cut with the Stylistics (""Betcha By Golly Wow,"" ""Can't Help Falling In Love"") and The O'Jays (""Backstabbers""). Sassy female soul is here too: Fontella Bass with ""Rescue Me,"" Dinah Washington contributes ""Mad About the Boy,"" and Etta James gets several tracks as well. There's also jazz by Roy Ayers, Nina Simone and Billy Stewart (""Summertime"") thrown into the diverse mix.<br /><br />I believe that this was a made-for-TV compilation; it's manufactured in Holland, and there's a Dutch ad in the liner notes.  The sound quality is impeccable, and it's great to have such a wide-ranging glimpse of pivotal soul, jazz, R&B and funk in a single collection. The liner notes are sparse (including only artist titles, labels, and copyright year), but sufficient (there are no photos or extra essays, etc.). It's like a self-contained time capsule of '60s and '70s soul, and is an eclectic collection even for those who own a majority of the material, since lesser-known gems fill out the selections.",[],B000N69OPS,B000N69OPS,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2011-06-22 00:27:07.000,1,False,"Very interesting ""all in one"" contemplation and manual on career development."
5.0,2Cellos steals the show!,"I first heard of 2Cellos when Amazon Germany e-mailed me saying that their debut album was available for preorder. 2Who? 2Cellos, like violinist David Garrett before them, seek to blend classical with rock. Luka ulic & Stjepan Hauser have lined up twelve songs ranging from U2 to Michael Jackson, Sting to NIN, even a dash of Guns n' Roses. However, what makes them unique from their competition is that these songs are totally unaccompanied other than Luka and Stjepan's blazing bows. That's right; no fancy orchestras, no studio wizardry, no overdubs...just...two cellos. If that sounds a little awkward, it really works in the context of most of the songs. Cellists Luka and Stjepan go beyond their classical roots and evoke any number of effects from their cellos, including rapid-fire bowing, pizzicato, and percussive slaps (think flamenco guitar). They bounce the melodies back and forth like a musical badminton match, seamlessly picking up lines from each other. The two have an amazing chemistry, even more so live (which is how they were first discovered after uploading one of their duets to YouTube and landing a guest spot on Ellen).<br /><br />""Smooth Criminal"" is obviously one of the most high-profile of the songs here, if only because David Garrett did a stellar violin cover on [[ASIN:B001UW58WW David Garrett]] (ditto for ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" on [[ASIN:B003O86MY8 Rock Symphonies]]). As these tracks are all acoustic, it can't compete with the tension of the original recording (or the opening drums and strings on David's version of ""Smooth Criminal""), but it holds its own (the opening aggressive bowing is kind of painful; imagine a cello with laryngitis, and that's the kind of tone they're pulling out in the intro). I actually thought Luka and Stjepan's cover of ""Human Nature"" was more impressive, capturing the soft, dreamy feel of the chorus. I preferred the slower songs like ""Fragile"" and ""Hurt"" more than the rock-influenced songs, but that's a personal preference.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, there will be comparisons between David Garrett and 2Cellos, if not for the ""stringed instruments play rock"" angle then the similar (if not identical) song choices that both groups have recently recorded and performed. They're both young, very handsome, and a little edgy (2Cellos in particular both look like they could be the leads in [[ASIN:B002JVWR9U The Vampire Diaries: The Complete First Season]]), all of which will appeal to a wider range of fans than a strictly classical repertoire would. Both groups pay homage to influential bands with slightly different approaches. I found the acoustic cello-centric approach fascinating; in the absence of studio effects, Luka and Stjepan are forced to create their own soundscapes using nothing more than the cello.<br /><br />I really enjoyed their debut album, and look forward to hearing much more from 2Cellos in the near future!",[],B004XWMXW4,B004XWMXW4,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2011-07-21 01:30:53.000,83,False,Hofstadter is such an awesome thinker/writer
5.0,David does it again...,"Much like his previous classical crossover albums [[ASIN:B0010NX274 Virtuoso]], [[ASIN:B001UW58WW David Garrett]], and [[ASIN:B003O86MY8 Rock Symphonies]], David has done it again on ""Music."" This time, we're treated to covers of Coldplay's ""Viva La Vida,"" Michael Jackson's ""Human Nature,"" Justin Timberlake's ""Cry Me A River,"" Queen's ""We Will Rock You,"" Misirlou, and Guns N Roses' ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and updates on Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy,"" Chopin, Clementi, Bach's Double Harpichord Concerto in C Major, and Kachaturian's ""Sabre Dance,"" among others. You'll also find a nod to James Bond rocking a riff from Led Zepplin's ""Whole Lotta Love"" and some Latin American and Celtic vibes on Tico Tico and Celtic Rondo.<br /><br />Most thrilling, David has gotten back to recording high-octane classical covers; the Beethoven Scherzo brings to mind the rollicking score from Pirates of the Caribbean. ""Sabre Dance"" bursts out of the gate with some serious electric guitar and turns it into a headbanging anthem. ""Whole Lotta Bond"" is a great update on a classic theme. There are slower, gentler sides of David in Chopin's ""Nocturne,"" Clementi - ""Sonata"" and ""Ode to Joy.""<br /><br />And let me be the first to say that I am NOT a fan of the cardboard packaging; it arrived from Germany slightly dented, and I had a devil of a time getting the discs out. You'll find the bilingual liner notes and three gorgeous photo ""postcards"" tucked into the middle. The Deluxe Edition features a Region 0 DVD with five videos (""Viva La Vida,"" The Making of Viva La Vida, ""Tico Tico"" (live from Hannover), ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" (live from Hannover) and ""Funiculi Funicula"" (live from Hanover). And it's great to finally see David literally letting his hair down in the liner notes (if there isn't a ""David Garrett's hair"" fanclub, I volunteer to start one!).<br /><br />Overall, Music is closest in composition to [[ASIN:B0010NX274 Virtuoso]], which still ranks as my #1 David album of all time for its balance of uptempo, classical, and original compositions. This is a must-have for new and old fans alike; be sure to spring for the Deluxe Edition if you can find it! And DEFINITELY spring for the Blu-Ray concert DVD of Music, which is currently only available through Amazon.de (ASIN: B009D2RQ30) It is PAL Region 0 and plays just fine on my Sony Blu-Ray DVD player. There are 28 tracks, including pretty much ALL the songs (and bonus tracks) from Music.

5.0,Short and sweet,"This LP was one of my thrift shop finds. I had this on CD already, but wanted the ambiance that only vinyl could provide and was not disappointed. The copy I managed to find was in very good condition. The album was recorded in a single session at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on August 5, 1955 and released the next year by Prestige as PRLP 7034.<br /><br />A major reason why I love this album is the inclusion of Ray Bryant on piano and Jackie McLean on alto sax. They seem way outside of Miles' normal sphere, but this was supposed to be an all star LP and on that count it succeeds. Some accounts of this session claim Miles' was disgusted with McLean for being high, but that is not evident in the playing. And Bryant's playing - never criticized - is exceptional to my ears.<br /><br />If there is a complaint, it's this album clocks in at 31 minutes.By today's standards it's very short. When it was released in 1956 the length was average.  While there are no sound samples on this page you can listen to them here: [[ASIN:B0055WICX0 Quintet/Sextet]].  Even on those short snippets what jumps out is the collaboration between Milt Jackson and Miles as well as McLean's contributions. Not only is his playing masterful, but Dr. Jackle and Minor March are his compositions. Ray Bryant contributed a composition as well: Changes. The remaining track is a Thad Jones composition that somehow got slipped into the track list.<br /><br />Another reason why I rated this so highly is the rhythm section. Byrant, as mentioned, is solid, but Percy Heath on bass and Art Taylor on drums make definite contributions by staying under the music and supporting it. Taylor is one of my favorite drummers from that era simply because he could play any groove and do so unobtrusively. He manages the same here and is locked in with Heath to give the melody instruments a foundation.",[],B0025KN40G,B0025KN40G,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-02 04:08:22.000,1,False,Quasi's Advice to Cats
5.0,Two album set,"This is really two older Blue Note albums compiled into a single set. The first nine tracks are from a 1952 session that is credited as the Milt Jackson Quintet, and is actually the Modern Jazz Quartet plus Lou Donaldson on alto sax. The remaining tracks are a 1948 collaboration between Jackson and Thelonious Monk.<br /><br />Since product pages sometimes get erroneously linked, the album I am reviewing is [[ASIN:B00005LKBZ Wizard Of The Vibes]], which contains a complete track listing as well as sound samples.  Run through the sound samples for a taste of the music because those short snippets convey far more about this album than I can describe with mere words.<br /><br />Interestingly, while this album is comprised of two very different groups, the compilation segues from one group to the next near seamlessly.<br /><br />The first nine tracks were recorded at the WOR Studios in NYC on April 7, 1952 and feature John Lewis on piano, Milt Jackson on vibraphone, Percy Heath on bass and original MJQ drummer Kenny Clarke. This core quartet backs and accompanies Lou Donaldson on alto sax.<br /><br />Tracks 10 through 17 were recorded at the Apex Studios in NYC on July 2, 1948 and credited as the Thelonious Monk Quartet. The line up is Monk and Jackson backed by John Simmons on  bass and Shadow Wilson on drums. Vocals are by Kenny Pancho Hagood.<br /><br />If you are a drummer you have probably already spotted the fact that this album features two of the greatest drummers of the era. Clarke was the father of bebop drumming and actually was a changing force in jazz drumming, and Wilson actually set the tone for most of Monk's drummers to come. In fact, if you listen to Wilson in this album, then listen to anything by Monk in 1961-63 featuring Frankie Dunlop on drums and you can hear strong echoes of Wilson.<br /><br />Drummers aside, this is a compilation that stands on its own merits with Jackson as the centerpiece.",[],B00005LKBZ,B00005LKBZ,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-03 04:08:47.000,1,False,5 Powerful Messages
5.0,Original album + bonus tracks,"I am reviewing the CD version of this album that contains bonus tracks from the 1960 Newport Jazz Festival: [[ASIN:B004GE80X0 Portrait of Duke Ellington]].<br /><br />First, the sound samples for the eleven tracks from the original release can be heard on the MP3 format titled [[ASIN:B00C10OBD4 A Portrait Of Duke Ellington]]. Listen to those tracks for a good indication of how Dizzy Gillespie handled this wonderful tribute. However, while the performances on the first eleven tracks of this set are excellent interpretations of the Duke's music, what makes this especially special is the arrangements by Clare Fischer. Normally I gloss over arrangers when I review albums, but in this case I want to highlight his role. For one thing he did not receive credit for literally decades, and for another this would have been a very different album without his arrangements.<br /><br />If you look over the personnel on the original album you can clearly see part of Fischer's genius. The brass section is countered by wind instruments, much the way the Duke arranged, but the instrumentation is different from any Ellington ensemble. Here we have Dizzy Gillespie on trumpet, Bennie Green on trombone, and a large French horn section comprised of Ray Alonge, Richard Berg and Joe Singer. To add even more bottom to this part of the orchestra Fischer added a tuba played by John McAllister. The wind instruments feature Robert DiDomenica on flute backed by a woodwind section comprised of Ernest Bright, John Murtaugh, Paul Richie, Stan Webb. Interestingly Fischer included a vibraphone (played by George Devens) and a strong rhythm section comprised of Hank Jones on piano (and celeste), George Duvivier on bass and Charlie Persip on drums.<br /><br />The bonus tracks were recorded on July 1, 1960 at the Newport Jazz Festival by Dizzy Gillespie on trumpet, Leo Wright on alto sax and flute, Junior Mance on piano, Art Davis on bass and Al Dreares on drums.",[],B004GE80X0,B004GE80X0,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-03 04:11:20.000,3,False,Finding Happiness?
5.0,"Well recorded,  but this is his only album as a leader","I first came across Tommy as a sideman on his brother's and Max Roach's albums, so when I saw this one years back I grabbed it. Common wisdom claims he was unrecognized, but in fact he was highly regarded among his peers and jazz enthusiasts. I won't go into his total discography as a sideman, but if you look it up he was definitely first call trumpet for some top musicians.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples on this album at [[ASIN:B002FDKYTC Tommy Turrentine]] for a taste of the music itself. It is certainly hard bop a la Jazz Messengers (and I have to wonder how he escaped a stint with that group.)  He shines on each track, especially as accompanied by a strong front line comprised of his brother Stanley on tenor sax and Julian Priester on trombone. The rhythm section is especially strong too -  Horace Parlan on piano, Bobby Boswell on bass and Max Roach on drums.<br /><br />Part of the reason this album is so tight is the fact that Tommy had extensive collaborations with most of the ensemble. He is featured on more than a few albums (and performances) with his brother, Parlan and Roach. It shows here because they are all on the same page musically.<br /><br />This album was recorded for the Bainbridge label at the Capitol Studios in NYC on January 19, 1960. One can lament the fact that this is his only album as a leader, but he is represented (and featured) on a number of other albums where his talent shines. On that count we are fortunate because he won't fall through the cracks like so many other talented musicians before and after him.",[],B0000AGWIP,B0000AGWIP,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-03 04:19:31.000,1,False,A Financial Lifestyle
5.0,Bebop meets Kansas City,"This is the best of both worlds to my ears. I love both Dizzy and his complex rhythms and advanced musical ideas, and Basie's swinging and bluesy Kansas City touch. Combining the two is some of the most laid back, interesting music I've encountered in a long time.<br /><br />Listen to the sound sample (if you are on a different product page you can hear them on [[ASIN:B000UBLWQA The Gifted Ones]]. Although the sound samples are not long enough to get the full flavor of the music I will focus on on track: St James Infirmary. This traditional song has its roots in an 18th century song and the melody is a familiar one. This rendition, however, sounds like the arranger was listening to Monk's 'Round Midnight when arranging it. The melody is there, but it's almost impressionistic. The entire album has these quirks. And to my ears those are what make it special.<br /><br />The recording was made in Las Vegas on February 3, 1977 and features Dizzy and Basie backed by Ray Brown on bass and Mickey Roker on drums. I usually expect to hear tenor saxophones when I think of Basie, so a trumpet in a quartet setting is a real treat. Also, Brown's bass adds a lot to the session, and Roker is perfect (to my ears) on drums.",[],B000000Z27,B000000Z27,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-04 02:34:39.000,1,False,A Book of Constant Doubting
5.0,High energy and some great performances a la Grantz,"This is a collection of jams that would have fallen through the cracks had they not been compiled into this album. In my opinion the 1977 Montreux Jazz Festival was like a fine wine vintage because it stands out for a lot of great music that was captured on record and film. Although this was not a Norman Granz festival, Granz backed many of the artists and produced a plethora of videos. In particular his touch is definitely evident in this album.<br /><br />There are sound samples on the MP3 album's page at [[ASIN:B000UBLOV8 Montreux '77: The Jam Sessions]], along with a track list (both of which are missing from this page at the time of this review). Give the samples a listen to get a feel for the music.<br /><br />The jams were all recorded between July 13 through 15, 1977 at the Casino. Here is the line-up for each track:<br /><br />Track 1, Red Top, July 13: Clark Terry on trumpet, Eddie Lockjaw Davis on tenor sax, Milt Jackson on vibraphone, Monty Alexander on piano, Ray Brown on  bass and Jimmie Smith on drums.<br /><br />Tracks 2 and 3, Perdido and Mack the Knife, July 14: Dizzy Gillespie and Clark Terry on trumpet,  Eddie Lockjaw Davis on tenor sax, Oscar Peterson on piano, Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen on bass and Bobby Durham on drums.<br /><br />Track 4, Freeport Jump, July 14: Roy Eldridge on trumpet, Vic Dickenson and Al Grey on trombone, Benny Carter on alto sax, Zoot Sims on tenor sax, Count Basie on piano, Ray Brown on bass and Jimmie Smith on drums.<br /><br />Track 5, Here 'Tis, July 14: Jon Faddis and Dizzy Gillespie on trumpet, Milt Jackson on vibraphone, Monty Alexander on piano,  Ray Brown on bass and Jimmie Smith on drums.<br /><br />Track 6, Donna Lee, July 15: Clark Terry on trumpet and flugelhorn, Ronnie Scott on tenor sax, Milt Jackson on vibraphone, Oscar Peterson on piano, Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen on bass, Joe Pass on guitar and Bobby Durham on drums.<br /><br />Truly an all-star line-up and some of the most energetic music to ever come out of the Montreux festival.",[],B000000YLH,B000000YLH,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-04 19:01:53.000,4,False,A True Ghost Story
5.0,Great voice backed by a great trio,"Since there is a set list in the product description I will not rehash that except to say that I liked her renditions of Cream's Sunshine of Your Love and the Beatle's Hey Jude. Of course the standards and other jazzier pieces stood out too, but hearing her wading into [at the time] current rock is a treat.<br /><br />Both video and audio quality are excellent considering the era and the fact that this is a live recording. The nice black and white contrasts with beautiful grey scale add a touch of realism.<br /><br />For me a highlight was having Ed Thigpen on drums. He is one of my main influences and the camera spent a lot of time with him in frame. Having Tommy Flanagan on piano is another plus because I am a huge fan of his. I am not as familiar with bassist Frank De La Rosa, but he turned in a spectacular performance as well.<br /><br />While I was thrilled to see Thigpen on this video, the real highlight is Ella who just shines with a piano trio backing. She nailed every song and I would be hard pressed to name a favorite, but I have to say that the opener, Give Me The Simple Life, not only set the tone of the rest of the concert, but grabbed me immediately. Another reason why I love this video is how natural and informal she was with the audience and her backing trio. That plus the realism of black and white made me feel as though I had a seat near the stage.<br /><br />If you are an Ella fan (likely since you are reading this), you will probably love this video. If you are a drummer, Ed Thigpen is in excellent form here, and, of course, the entire trio is on fire from the opening with Thigpen on drums as the De La Rosa, Flanagan and Ella come on to the stage, to the finale.",[],B0007QS2F2,B0007QS2F2,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-05 16:39:37.000,2,False,Ghost Stories That Are Amusing Not Scary
5.0,Interesting arrangements with a West coast flair,"I keep coming back to this album. One reason is Marty Paich's arrangements and the other is the ensemble. Listen to the sound samples on this page for a taste of just how delightful the combination of arrangements and performances is.<br /><br />There are three different mallet players on this album: Gibbs on vibraphone and marimba, and both Larry Bunker and Victor Feldman on vibraphone and xylophone. Gibbs is one of the more aggressive mallet players who is - to me - second only to Lionel Hampton when it comes to fast motor and nimble playing. Bunker and Feldman were both drummers who were also excellent on mallets. In fact, Feldman was also a pianist of note who recorded on that instrument, vibraphone and drums, so the percussive aspect of this unique ensemble is textured with a lot of dynamics.<br /><br />The remaining ensemble is comprised of Lou Levy on piano, Max Bennett and Mel Lewis on drums. In other words, an all-star group and some of the top West Coast musicians ever. The sound samples convey the overall musicality of each song, which this group pulls off, but as I alluded to in the beginning a major part of the success of this album is Paich's arrangements.<br /><br />This was originally recorded for the Mode Records label in Los Angeles in  September 1957. It was re-released by the Interlude label as Esprit De Jazz in 1959.",[],B00000AGFY,B00000AGFY,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-08 12:08:23.000,1,False,Unlock Your Learning Potential
5.0,WW I meets West Coast Jazz,"Of all of the West Coast albums in my library (and I have many) this is one of the more eclectic ones. One reason is aside from the last track - Vamp's Blues - each song was popular during the nineteen-teens and were popular during World War I.<br /><br />If you are on the CD product page you will not find a track list or sound samples. You can find those here: [[ASIN:B008C7POJ0 The Vamp's Blues]]. Many of the songs are timeless, like track 1, After You've Gone. Others have fallen into obscurity. Bear in mind that when this album was recorded in 1957 many of the obscure ones were still in the public's mind since 'the war to end all wars' ended less than forty years prior. The last track, Vamp's Blues, was written by Charlie Mariano who was not born until after the war (in 1923). Still, the overall theme of this album, with a distinct West Coast flavor, is what drew me to it.<br /><br />This was recorded in Los Angeles for the World Pacific label at the Radio Recorders studio on December 10 and 11, 1957. It was originally released as Beauties of 1918.<br /><br />Charlie Mariano is on alto sax (and recorder on Deep River), Jerry Dodgion is on alto sax and flute, Victor Feldman is on vibraphone, Jimmy Rowles on piano, Monty Budwig on bass and Shelly Manne on drums.<br /><br />The entire album clocks in at 48:14.

5.0,"Simply beautiful music, some of which was improvised in the studio","I've owned a copy of this album in one form or another for literally decades. My inspiration to write this review is I pulled it out today (this particular CD release) and was re-enchanted. As others have mentioned, the heart and soul is the title track. However there is much more to this album that just that.<br /><br />First, listen to the sound samples to get a flavor of each track. Some, like Idle Moments are laid back and flowing, others are straight ahead and will have you tapping your foot (although even those have a laid back quality.)<br /><br />While the original release with just four tracks would be a gem, this re-release by Blue Note with the two alternate takes is even more valuable. One reason is tracks 5 and 6 are how those songs were intended to be released, but they had to  be cut short because track 1 went way over in length due to a misconception when it was being recorded.  Although there were retakes of track 1, none were as good as the first, longer take, so retakes were make of tracks 2 and 3, which were originally 5 and 6.<br /><br />Although not released until 1965 the album was recorded for Blue Note at Rudy van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio on November 4 and 15, 1963. The ensemble was fronted by Green on guitar, Joe Henderson on  tenor sax and Bobby Hutchinson on vibraphone. The rhythm section was Duke Pearson on piano, Bob Crenshaw on bass and Al Harewood on drums. Both Green and Pearson composed three of the four titles on this album - Pearson wrote Idle Moments and Nomad, and Green wrote Jean de Fleur.

5.0,Essential for Konitz fans,"I actually owned a vinyl copy of this album, which I long since lost. When I discovered it reissued on CD I snapped it up.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples on this page for an indication of not only the music, but the sound quality. Both are excellent to my ears, but bear in mind that some of my opinion may be clouded by the joy of reacquiring this album. Note: on the first track, No Splice, it sounds as though there are two saxophones. There aren't. It's a remarkable interplay between Konitz and his pianist Ronnie Ball. In fact, the way Konitz and Ball connect on each track is one of the reasons why I deem this to be an essential album for fans. And musicians who I am sure will be filled with ideas listening to this album.<br /><br />The first seven tracks were recorded for the Storyville label at an unspecified location and date other than Boston (presumably Harvard Square) in April 1954. Konitz and Ball are backed by Peter Ind on bass and Jeff Morton on drums. The final three tracks were also recorded in Boston - again, Harvard Square - in  February 1955. Here the rhythm section is Percy Heath on bass and Al Levitt on drums.",[],B0000015S4,B0000015S4,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-14 16:10:19.000,2,False,Handy to Keep on Your Desk
5.0,A gem from 1956,"This album is another treasure by Konitz from the mid 1950s. This one stands out because he plays half the album on alto sax and the other half on tenor. On the original LP the A side was dedicated to alto and the B side to tenor. Actually, he plays both saxophones on track 1 after the guitar solo.<br /><br />If you are not on the MPs version's page there are no sound samples at the time of this review. You can listen to them here: [[ASIN:B00124JDJ2 Inside Hi-Fi (US Release)]]. Interestingly, Konitz splits this album in half, with Billy Bauer on guitar as the chordal instrument on the first four tracks and the chordal instrument on the second four tracks features Sal Mosca on piano. The contrast is interesting. Especially the interplay between Bauer and Konitz, but you can also hear echoes of Lenny Tristano on the second half. Tristano's influence permeates this album in that Konitz was heavily influenced, along with Peter Ind. You hear that influence more on the final four tracks.<br /><br />This album was recorded for Atlantic at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio. Tracks 1 through 4 were recorded on October 21 and 22, 1956 with Konitz on alto sax, backed by Billy Bauer on guitar, Arnold Fishkind on bass and Dick Scott on drums.<br /><br />Tracks 5 through 8 on October 26, 1956 with Konitz on tenor sax, backed by Sal Mosca on piano, Peter Ind on bass and Dick Scott on drums.",[],B000IU37Z2,B000IU37Z2,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-14 16:35:26.000,6,False,Beautiful Thoughts For Those Who Are Grieving
5.0,Some of the most beautiful music Konitz recorded,"My opinion, of course, is subjective, but to my ear this is one of my favorite Konitz albums. Normally any jazz album with strings is a gamble for me,  but this is among a handful that is so well done that I find myself listening to it over and over.<br /><br />Unfortunately there are no sound samples, so I will try to give an idea of the music. This is NOT anything like Bird's Charlie Parker With Strings. I view that album as another jazz masterpiece. This one is more along the lines of what Chico Hamilton was doing on the west coast during the same time period with interesting arrangements, and less traditional instruments. If you are familiar with Bird's album, this one is different in that Konitz is integrated into the ensemble, interacting with the strings whereas Bird's arrangements used a lush string ensemble as a foundation across which his alto sax notes would float.<br /><br />There is a full orchestra backing Konitz, but there is also a core ensemble that is comprised of Konitz on alto sax, Gene Orloff on violin, Alan Shulman on cello, Lou Stein on piano and Billy Bauer on guitar. In particular, there are moments on this album where Konitz and Bauer are 'in the zone' that, alone, make this album worth owning. Bill Russo's arrangements (and conducting) also add a lot to the music.<br /><br />This album was recorded for Verve in NYC on February 6 and 8, 1958 and released the same year. If you are leery of jazz with strings and are a Konitz fan, give this one a chance because Lee's alto sax is simply beautiful in this ensemble.",[],B000QUCXRM,B000QUCXRM,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-16 13:41:03.000,5,False,Delightful Story
5.0,Excellent two album set,"This set features Giuffre's involvement as both player or arranger/conductor on both albums, as well as Bill Evans on most of the tracks. The Evans collaboration is one of the main reasons why I purchased this album. For one thing I am a fan of both Konitz and Evans, and for another it's interesting to hear the contrasts between Evans and the Lenny Tristano collaborations that I also own that feature Konitz. Both albums were recorded for Verve.<br /><br />I am reviewing the CD, which at currently does not have a track list or sound samples on the page. You can find and listen to those here: [[ASIN:B00NNJQ5DQ You and Lee + Lee Konitz Meets Jimmy Giuffre (feat. Bill Evans)]]. The snippets from each track will give you a great idea of what is on this compilation, which sounds somewhat seamless since all of the tracks were recorded in 1959 and all have Giuffre's involvement in some form or another. Of course, there is the Bill Evans touch as well.<br /><br />Tracks 1 through 8 are the album titled You & Lee. Tracks 1, 2, 4 and 8 feature Bill Evans on piano, and 3, 5, 6 and 7 feature Jim Hall on guitar instead of Evans. The rest of the ensemble on 1, 2, 4 and 8 are Konitz accompanied by  Ernie Royal, Marky Marowitz and Phil Sunkel on trumpet, Eddie Bert and Billy Byers on trombone, and backed by Sonny Dallas on bass and Roy Haynes on drums. The remaining tracks feature the same line-up except the trombone section is Byers alone. These tracks were recorded in NYC on October 20 and 30, 1959 with Giuffre as both arranger and conductor.<br /><br />The remaining tracks are the album titled Lee Konitz Meets Jimmy Giuffre (also arranged by Giuffre), that was recorded in NYC on May 12, 1959. The ensemble features Konitz and Hal McKusick on alto sax, Ted Brown and Warne Marsh on tenor sax and Giuffre on baritone sax.

5.0,Smokin' live performance,"I've owned a copy of this album in one format or another for over twenty-five years. Although my tastes have changed to jazz piano trio music, this one still gets a lot of play time and never ceases to make me smile and tap my foot.<br /><br />Since there are sound samples on this page ([[ASIN:B000000XE0 The Late Show]]) you can run through those to get a tantalizing taste of the music. Those samples will not convey the overall feel of this album, which requires a listen to all of the tracks, but you will get the gist of it.<br /><br />What keeps me coming back is the recording quality and performance itself make me feel as though it's  May 30, 1986 and I am in the audience at Marla's Memory Lane Supper Club in Los Angeles. Few live albums can make you suspend disbelief like that.<br /><br />You can clearly hear that the musicians are 'on' that night. There is an energy that is intense. Of course, Etta's voice (and personality) are the centerpiece, and she delivers each song perfectly.<br /><br />The entire band on stage is Etta backed by Eddie 'Cleanhead' Vinson on alto sax, Red Holloway on tenor sax, Jack McDuff on organ, Shuggie Otis on guitar, Richard Reid on bass and Paul Humphrey on drums.

5.0,Some of Etta James' finest live recordings,"This is the perfect companion to [[ASIN:B000000XE0 The Late Show]], which was recorded during the same May 1986 run at Marla's Memory Lane Supper Club in Los Angeles. Whereas the late show was recorded on May 30, tracks from this album are from May 30 and 31. Apparently these tracks are the best of the best from the those dates. To my ears it sounds like it.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples on this page. There is a lot of ambiance from the way Etta engages the audience and the audience itself, which is tastefully captured on tape. Like the other album, this one makes you feel as though you are there. The backing ensemble is definitely warmed up and not merely going through the motions. There is an energy coming off this album that makes it so compelling and why I rated it so highly.<br /><br />I'd be hard pressed to pick a single, favorite track, but if forced, it would probably be a toss-up between I Just Wanna Make Love To You and Lover Man. On the latter Etta manages to capture some of the same emotion that Billy Holiday put into te song when she first sang it in 1944. However, that only reflects my personal taste and not necessarily what you would pick. No matter which track, though, you cannot go wrong with this album or any song on it because there are no duds in my opinion.<br /><br />The line-up backing Etta is Eddie 'Cleanhead' Vinson on alto sax (and vocals on Please Send Me Someone to Love), Red Holloway on tenor sax, Jack McDuff on organ, Shuggie Otis on guitar, Richard Reid on bass and Paul Humphrey on drums.",[],B000000XDW,B000000XDW,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-17 13:35:01.000,1,False,An Essential Guide to New York
5.0,Two very different masters live,"There are a number of reviews that already go into detail, so I will confine my remarks to the differences between Flanagan and Byard, and who did what on which tracks.<br /><br />After the brief introduction that comprises track 1, the pair launch into a duet on tracks 2, 3 and 4. The musical choices are as widely separated as Flanagan's and Byard's approach to piano because it's almost dizzying to assimilate. To me anyway, because the shift from Bird's composition to a Cole Porter one, to an Ellington tune was like a bobsled ride.<br /><br />Things settle down on tracks 5, 8 and 10 when Flanagan goes solo. Unsurprisingly he picks Billy Strayhorn compositions. Flanagan was an avid Strayhorn fan, and the three songs are all in his 'zone' where he showcases his style.<br /><br />Tracks 6, 9 and 11 are Byard's where he solos. His choice of songs are as eclectic as his musical style. I was not surprised that among his showcase selections he picked a Stevie Wonder composition. In addition to the music selection his playing is so different from Flanagan's that you wonder how the pulled off the tracks where they played as a duet.<br /><br />The final tracks, 7 and 12, where they rejoin as a duet are evidence that two very different pianists can sit down and create magic together.<br /><br />Of course the real magic is this is a live album and I seriously doubt that Flanagan and Byard rehearsed any of the songs together. I could be wrong, but I have a number of albums by both and know that each was able to improvise and arrange on the fly. I am guessing that they approached the performance captured on this album as fun.",[],B00BG4CTPS,B00BG4CTPS,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-18 16:26:26.000,2,False,Therapeutic Journaling
5.0,Ground zero for hard bop,"This album is important because it predates the Jazz Messengers. That gives the music some historical context. There are other editions of this album available, but this one stands out for mastering and sound quality. If you are an audiophile who cannot find this in vinyl, this particular CD is the next best thing.<br /><br />There is no track list or sound samples on this page as I write this. You can find both here: [[ASIN:B000TRTRGM Horace Silver Trio (Rudy Van Gelder Edition)]]. Let the sound samples on that page guide you because they convey more about the music than I can describe in words.<br /><br />This album that was originally released in 1953 as Blue Note BLP 1520. The sessions that produced the 14 original tracks were recorded at the WOR Studios in NY. They were split between two in October 1952 and one in November 1953.<br /><br />The first session was on October 9, 1952 with Horace Silver on piano, Gene Ramey on bass and Art Blakey on drums. The second session was on October 20, 1952. Curly Russell replaces Gene Ramey on bass. The final session was recorded on November 23, 1953 with Percy Heath on bass backing Horace and Art.",[],B0007INZSY,B0007INZSY,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-18 16:35:57.000,3,False,Decide to Go Happy
5.0,A loving tribute by Pass and Pisano,"First, let me say that if you are expecting gypsy jazz, which the title implies, or bebop,which many critics claim you may be disappointed. More importantly, none of Django's style is mimiced in this album. It's a tribute and one that was lovingly performed by Pass in his own style.<br /><br />Not widely credited is John Pisano who is playing rhythm guitar, and he is backed by Jim Hughart on bass and Colin Bailey on drums. The entire mood of this album is light, straight ahead jazz with Pass in his particular zone and Pisano joined to him musically. The rhythm section is masterful in their support.<br /><br />It's a pity that there are no sound samples on this page because those would provide the essence of this album more than I can describe. I will say that if you are familiar with Joe Pass you will immediately recognize his style, and it is not like anything Django played.<br /><br />Since there are no tracks listed as I write this I am going to provide them and their times (the entire album clocks in at 38:32, so it's relatively short by today's standards.)<br /><br />1.  Django  3:23<br />2.  Rosetta  3:09<br />3.  Nuages 2:35<br />4.  For Django. 3:01<br />5.  Night And Day 3:47<br />6.  Fleur D'ennui  2:57<br />7.  Insensiblement  3:15<br />8.  Cavalerie  4:26<br />9.  Django's Castle  3:49<br />10. Limehouse Blues  2:16<br /><br />Tracks 3, 6, 8 and 9 are Django compositions, while track 10 is probably the one song for which he is best known. Also, track 4 is a Joe Pass composition, and the rest are standards ranging from John Lewis' tribute (track 1), to a Cole Porter composition and others.<br /><br />This album was recorded for Pacific Records in Los Angeles on September 2 and 18, 1964 and released the same year. For me it epitomizes what a true tribute album should be: played in the style of whoever is paying tribute without trying to mimic or copy the object of the tribute. In that respect this album is a masterpiece.",[],B00LSYYGSY,B00LSYYGSY,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-18 23:40:21.000,3,False,Social Selling
5.0,Webster + Oscar Peterson Trio + Stan Levey,"This is one of the swingingest, blues-infused albums Webster ever made. He and Peterson collaborated more than a few times and it's evident that they (and the rest of the ensemble) are in synch musically.<br /><br />While there are no sound samples on the CD's page as I write this you can listen to them here: [[ASIN:B000V63CHQ Soulville]]. I am not going to attempt to describe the music since those snippets will tell you everything you need to know.<br /><br />The original release only contained the first seven tracks. The bonus tracks are from the same October 15, 1957 session recorded for Verve in Los Angeles. What distinguishes those final three tracks is Webster is on piano. He is also credited as composer on tracks 1, 2 and 9, so this is, indeed, his album.<br /><br />The rest of the ensemble is Peterson's trio (Ray Brown on bass and Herb Ellis on guitar), and Stan Levey on drums. Levey is one of my idols - he was right handed and played a left handed kit, and was a physically powerful man (ex boxer) who had a wide dynamic range and impeccable time. He also was a protege of sorts, first playing with Dizzy Gillespie when Levey was only 16. Of course, Ray Brown and Herb Ellis are giants on their respective instruments, so the magic is definitely in this album.",[],B000004765,B000004765,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-19 19:29:59.000,3,False,An Excellent Guide
5.0,One of my favorite post-Prestige Trane albums,"This is one of two Trane albums that he recorded after leaving Prestige that I love. The other is his collaboration with Johnny Hartman ([[ASIN:B000W1MEFG John Coltrane And Johnny Hartman]]), and both show a side of Trane that we sometimes forget. There was much more to him than his sheets of sound and fascination with triads.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples on this page to hear what I mean. Trane would do ballads with the best of them. In fact, this album is evidence that he would give Ben Webster a run for his money in that department.<br /><br />The album was recorded for the Impulse label over the course of three sessions at Rudy van Gelder's, Englewood Cliffs, NJ Studio. The first session was on December 21, 1961 and featured Trane backed by McCoy Tyner on piano, Reggie Workman on bass and Elvin Jones on drums. That session produced Greensleeves and It's Easy To Remember. The final two sessions has Jimmy Garrison on bass and were on September 18 and November 13,1962.<br /><br />If you are a drummer do pay attention to Elvin's brushwork, which is exquisite.",[],B000W4KSVA,B000W4KSVA,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-19 21:00:12.000,0,False,Meaningful Poems
5.0,Prestige capitalizing on Trane,"Trane was at Atlantic when Prestige culled songs from 1957 and 1958 recording sessions and released them on this compilation in March 1961. For me the Prestige years are my favorite, so this album is one of my many favorites. In fact, I own a copy on vinyl and CD, as well as a ripped album on my phone.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples on this page to hear enough of each track to get a sense of the music: [[ASIN:B000UBQO22 Lush Life]]. One thing you will hear is that the first three tracks are Trane with bass and drums. No piano. This format was pioneered by Sonny Rollins, so it's interesting that Trane opted for such an ensemble back in 1957 after extensive work with Miles Davis who loved pianos in his ensembles. Another is the fact that since the tracks were culled from three different recording sessions the album is not as seamless because of the different personnel and instruments.<br /><br />All of the tracks were recorded in Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio. The first three are from August 16, 1957 with Trane backed by Earl May on bass and Art Taylor on drums. May had a long association with Billy Taylor and is one of the more accomplished bassists from his era. It's a shame he is not better known because his playing was up there with the best jazz bassists as evidenced by what you hear on these tracks. Taylor was probably the most ubiquitous drummer of the era who shows up on numerous jazz albums. His playing is always tasteful and perfect, so it's no surprise that he was chosen for this session.<br /><br />Track 4 was recorded on January 10, 1958 with Trane accompanied by Donald Byrd on trumpet and backed by Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass and Louis Hayes on drums. Byrd and Trane are excellent together. Trane had an extensive association with Garland and Chambers from his stint with Miles Davis. Hayes who would be closely associated with another Miles Davis alumni, Cannonball Adderley, adds a lot to this track as well.<br /><br />The last track was recorded on May 31, 1957 with Trane backed by a rhythm section comprised of Garland and Chambers, with Tootie Heath on drums.",[],B000000Y7L,B000000Y7L,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-20 14:38:04.000,6,False,Fly with Confidence
5.0,Ground zero for Trane as a leader,"This album was Trane's first as a leader, and an auspicious move from sideman to a force to be reckoned with in his own right. It would be a few years before he got out of Miles Davis' shadow, but his signature sheets of sound is evident on this album.<br /><br />Unfortunately there are no sound samples at the time of this review. Although Trane is coming into his own, the arrangements and performances on this album are somewhat safe. Almost as if he's testing the waters. He did manage to get two of his own compositions onto the album, which shows the high regard in which Prestige held him: Straight Street and Chromic Blues.<br /><br />Half of this album - the first three tracks - feature Red Garland leading the rhythm section on piano, and the last three tracks has pianist Mal Waldron leading them. Paul Chambers and Tootie Heath are the bassist and drummer, respectively, and combined with the pianists form an excellent foundation for Trane and accompanists Johnnie Splawn trumpet on all of the tracks except 2 and 3, which are Trane and the rhythm section, and Sahib Shihab on baritone sax on tracks 1, 4 and 6.<br /><br />This album was recorded at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on May 31, 1957 and clocks in at 41:50.",[],B000000Y0Z,B000000Y0Z,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-20 22:47:35.000,2,False,Make Peace with Food

5.0,A powerful trio of all stars,"This is Raney's album since he has leader credits, but the trio (trios actually) is like picking a dream team. Tommy Flanagan on piano is absolutely superb, and George Mraz on bass combine to be the perfect rhythm section for Raney. On the last track, All the Things You Are, drummer Lewis Nash is added, while Flanagan is absent, so you can hear Raney in two different trio formats.<br /><br />Mraz composed the title track, while Raney is credited as composer for Ovals. There are two Benny Golson titles (Hassan's Dream and Out of the Past), and the remaining three tracks are standards.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples on this page for a hint of the music. It can range from straight-ahead to free, but always showcasing the talents of each musician. In most trio settings a single musician or instrument will dominate. Here each member (including Nash on the last track) is an equal contributor.<br /><br />This album was recorded for the Criss Cross Jazz label in two sessions. The first session with Raney, Flanagan and Mraz was recorded at Rudy van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio on December 30, 1985. That session produced the first six tracks. The final track was recorded at the Manhattan Recording Studio on December 5, 1990 featuring Raney, Mraz and Nash. This album clocks in at 47:00 and if you are a fan of Raney or Flanagan it's a worthwhile listen.

3.0,Five star music marred by poor mastering,"I purchased this because a tragedy befell my existing collection of the songbook albums and this set seems like a great way to replace them inexpensively.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the mastering of this set is poor, which I did not expect from Verve. What I mean is the Cole Porter/Richard Rogers tracks on Disc 1 are identical to the Harold Arlen tracks on Disc 4 (and they are all the Arlen songbook.) I double checked to make sure that there were no duplicate Disc 4s and there were not. The Porter/Rogers Disc was clearly marked Disc 1 and the Arlen one was clearly marked Disc 4 on the physical media.<br /><br />Also, the disc volume names have no consistency in naming conventions. What this means is if you are ripping these to MP3 files to play on a phone or other player, you will get some albums with good metadata, and others that are such a mess that you'll throw up your hands. I had to send this back and will replace the lost collection that I mentioned above with separate albums. That is because the music itself is excellent.<br /><br />The sound quality of the tracks in this album is superb, which only adds to my frustration that Verve did not pay sufficient attention to metadata and mastering to get this right. Especially since they did such a great job on the informative booklet that is included.<br /><br />If you are wondering about contents , the albums in this set were recorded when Oscar with bassist Ray Brown and drummer Ed Thigpen holed up in the Universal Recording Studios in Chicago for over three weeks. The albums in this set came out of that marathon session, which lasted from July 14 to August 9, 1959.<br /><br />I am including what SHOULD have been in this set in a comment below.",[],B00284G370,B00284G370,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-23 01:45:36.000,2,True,A Lifestyle Choice
5.0,"Not essential, but highly recommended for fans","I own a lot of Raney's recorded work and while this album is not on my personal short list of favorites, it's still stellar in my opinion. I am tempted to call it masterful, but that would be a pun.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples on this page to get a feel for the music. One thing you will notice is Raney loved standards, and this album has a nice sprinkling of Porter, Kern, Hammerstein, etc. It also has some nice surprises such as Charlie Parker's Billie's Bounce and J. J. Johnson's Lament. If you are a fan of Raney's you will also notice that he has included a Benny Golson composition - Along Came Betty - on the album. Many of Raney's albums contain Golson compositions (although I have yet to find a recorded instance of I Remember Clifford.)<br /><br />This album was recorded in the Netherlands for the Criss Cross Jazz label on February 16, 1983. Raney is accompanied by Kirk Lightsey on piano and backed by Jesper Lundgaard on bass and Eddie Gladden on drums.",[],B0000020LC,B0000020LC,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-23 02:11:25.000,3,False,A Quick Guide
5.0,Almost like the Jazz Messengers with a guitar,"I came across this CD while looking for Jazz Messengers gems and this one qualifies. The vibe at the Five Spot is excellent, and the music is has a small venue feel to it. That does not mean it's subdued because in fact it's intense in every respect.<br /><br />This album contains three bonus tracks that are from the same night and venue, but never made it on the original album. Ironically, those tracks show up on a Blue Note album titled Swingin' that was a mix of studio and live tracks. I'll get to the bonus tracks below. For the main album as originally released you can listen to sound samples (tracks 1 through 5) here: [[ASIN:B0048Y41MW On View At The Five Spot Cafe]].<br /><br />The main tracks are from sets 2 through 5, all recorded on August 25, 1959. There are personnel changes between sets, so here is the line up for each track. Note that the core ensemble on all tracks are Kenny Burrell on guitar, Art Blakey on drums and Ben Tucker on bass.<br />Tracks 1 and 3 are from the second set and feature Tina Brooks on tenor sax and Bobby Timmons on piano with the core ensemble.<br /><br />Track 2 is from the third set and feature the core ensemble with Roland Hanna replacing Timmons on piano.<br /><br />Track 4 is from the fifth set with Timmons back on piano.<br /><br />Track 5 is from the fourth set with Hanna on piano.<br /><br />The three bonus tracks are Swingin' from the second set mentioned above and Beef Stew Blues from the third set.

5.0,"Freddie, Papa Jo and Ossie (among others) - Oh my!","I love this album for a myriad of reasons, not the least of which is it features Green as his first (and I believe only) album as leader. He shared leader on an album he did with Herb Ellis twenty years later, but this one has a different vibe that only could have been achieved with some Basie alumni in the mix.<br /><br />As a drummer there are two other reasons why I love this album: (1) Papa Jo Jones and (2) Osie Johnson. They are two drummers that I most admire. Add in the fact that the remainder of the ensemble are all on the same musical page (especially bassist Milt Hinton) and you have the ingredients for magic.<br /><br />Sadly there are no sound samples as I write this, but if you are familiar with Basie small groups you will have a good idea about the music. More importantly, Green's acoustic guitar is where it should be in the mix: mainly felt, but also audible.<br /><br />This entire album was recorded in a single day at Webster Hall in NYC on December 18, 1955. The core line-up is comprised of Joe Newman on trumpet, Henry Coker on trombone and Al Cohn on tenor sax, clarinet and bass clarinet. The rhythm section is comprised of Nat Pierce on piano,  Green on guitar, Milt Hinton on bass and drummers Papa Jo Jones (tracks 2, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 12) and Osie Johnson (tracks 1, 3, 6. 8, 9 and 11). In addition there are three arrangers on this album: Al Cohn (tracks 1, 2 and 7), Manny Albam (tracks 4 through 6 and 8) and Ernie Wilkins (tracks 3 and 9 through 12).

5.0,A time capsule,"This album was recorded in 1946 and not released until authorized by Cole's estate fifty-three years later. To be honest, it was not commercial material at the time it was recorded as a live radio broadcast by WEMP from the Hotel LaSalle' Circle Room in Milwaukee.<br /><br />Before proceeding I hope you run through the sound samples and decide for yourself. To my ears the sound quality is surprisingly good for the era and the fact that it was a live broadcast.<br /><br />It goes without saying that the music is first rate. How could it be otherwise? This is probably the strongest line-up of the trio with Oscar Moore on guitar and Johnny Miller on bass. While both well equally well versed in melody, harmony and rhythm, Moore is the brighter star if only because he invented a number of chords that are still the mainstay of jazz guitar. He also had an influence on Charlie Christian who influenced in one way or the other all who came after him. That's not to diminish Miller's contribution. The trio would not have the same magic without him, and, of course, Cole's incredible piano chops are as evident as his vocal ones. For the record, additional vocals on both renditions of Oh, But I Do (tracks 2 and 15) are Moore and Miller.<br /><br />This album was recorded over the span of September 21 through 23 and 26, 1946. Tracks 1, 10, 11 and 15 through 17 are from the 25th, tracks 2 through 5 from the 21st, 6 through 9 the 22nd and 12 through 14 on the 23rd.<br /><br />This is indeed a time capsule and definitely an album any musician (including drummer) in a jazz piano trio should study.

5.0,Rabbit and Fatha in great form,"I love this album because Hodges and Hines just seem to be on the same page musically on each track.

You can get a sense of the music here: [[ASIN:B000W1A7C8 Stride Right]]. As you run through the tracks not only do Hodges and Hines add to the music, the rest of the ensemble does as well. I will say that Hodges' creamy alto sax tone is a perfect complement to Hines' own horn-like approach to playing.<br /><br />The first three tracks are Hines compositions followed by the remaining tracks associated with Ellington and alumni (and, by extension, Hodges.) There is not a dud among them to my ears, but you can let the sound samples and your own ears  be the judge.<br /><br />This album was recorded in a single session for Verve in NYC on January 14, 1966.

5.0,A transitional album,"This album was recorded for Verve in NYC over the course of two late 1965 and one early 1966 sessions. This album, like many Hodges did as leader or co-leader are mostly a combination of his compositions and Ellington (associated) ones. Tracks A1, A3 and B4 are Hodges', A4 was composed by Wild Bill Davis, and the remainder (except for A4 and B2) are tunes strongly associated with the Ellington orchestra.<br /><br />Here are the tracks on this album:<br />A1 Blues For Madeleine 4:48<br />A2 Feelin' Kinda Blues 2:30<br />A3 Blue Pyramid 2:10<br />A4 Nonchalance 4:45<br />A5 At Dawn 3:00<br />B1 The Brown-Skin Gal In The Calico Gown 2:35<br />B2 Stormy Weather 3:56<br />B3 Rabbit Out Of The Hat 5:10<br />B4 Hash Brown 4:00<br /><br />The core front line is made up entirely of Ellington alumni (Hodges on alto sax, Lawrence Brown on trombone and Jimmy Hamilton on clarinet). Wild Bill Davis is on organ, Billy Butler on guitar and Bob Bushnell on electric bass. Bushell is unique for the era; the only other jazz musician who routinely played electric bass during this time was Monk Montgomery (Wes' brother). The drum chair was the only change based on session. On the November 19, 1965 (Feelin' Kinda Blues) and December 27, 1965 sessions (At Dawn and Blue Pyramid) the drummer was Herbie Lovelle. The remaining tracks were recorded on January 17, 1966 with Joe Marshall on drums, except for Brown Skin Gal, which featured Hodges' son - Johnny Jr. - on drums.<br /><br />While the music has the expected Ellingtonian flavor, it is actually a precursor to funk thanks to Davis and Bushnell. As such this is a transitional album that reflects an evolution point in jazz. Interestingly the core ensemble were all swing musicians from an earlier era trailblazing and forging a new sound. I wonder if they consciously realized that when they were cutting this album.",[],B002BY7PFG,B002BY7PFG,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-27 20:35:38.000,0,False,Inspirational and Funny
5.0,Start of a craze,"As a teenager this album caught my attention like few others (this pre-dated the British Invasion). To this day I pull it out because of both the nostalgia and because it is a clear example of simple musical arrangements that have a nice hook. In fact, most of this album employed overdubbing and other tricks.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples for an indication of the music itself. Note that this is the infamous stereo version where the ensemble is coming in your right ear while the trumpet is in the left if you are wearing phones. Also, Alpert did some ingenious things to achieve the effect of multiple trumpets on some tracks, like the title one, where he would overdub with the additional 'trumpet' slightly offset. It works.<br /><br />If you are from my era you remember the TJB craze that lasted for a decade. This album is ground zero - Alpert's first TJB album, so if you are a fan this has historical significance.<br /><br />In addition to some clever studio tricks this album gives the impression of being a collection of mariachi standards. It isn't. Alpert composed Tijuana Sauerkraut, Struttin' With Maria and A Quiet Tear, while his drummer brother Dave composed Acapulco 1922.<br /><br />Sadly many of the studio musicians are not credited (or even confirmed) on this album. This one predates the Wrecking Crew participation by a number of years, and the best I can find regarding other musicians are Bob Edmondson on trombone and Julius Wechter on marimba and other percussion. I am guessing that brother Dave is also on drums and percussion, but the rest of the ensemble is nearly impossible to identify and confirm.<br /><br />This album was recorded as the A&M (Alpert and Moss) label's first album in 1962 at the Conway Recorders studio in Los Angeles and released the same year.",[],B000771T1A,B000771T1A,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-29 04:28:34.000,3,False,A Pocket Guide for Personal Growth
5.0,A study in melody and harmony,"Rarely do I listen to guitar-centric music (I prefer piano jazz trios), but this album is a musical masterpiece.<br /><br />For one thing, Ellis and Pass are so mutually complementary that I find myself listening to this gem frequently. Honestly I cannot tell who is who on this album, but I noticed right off that when one is playing melody the other is playing harmony more than rhythm. I have to assume that they are taking turns.<br /><br />Another reason why I love this album is it's just Ellis and Pass. No drums or bass (or piano.) What a treat to be able to hear the interplay between the two without any other instrument in the mix. Of course if you are a guitarist you are going to get a lot from this album, but any musician who listens carefully will be treated to ideas that are bound to influence.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples on this page for an idea of what I am talking about regarding melody and harmony. As importantly, the selection of songs is another factor. It allows Ellis and Pass to showcase their talents in a variety of musical pieces ranging from standards to Brazilian, and at different tempos.<br /><br />The album was recorded for Normal Granz' Pablo label in Los Angeles on January 30, and February 13 and 20, 1974 and released the same year.",[],B000000YXG,B000000YXG,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-29 13:30:30.000,1,False,Cute Book About Sprouting Lentils
5.0,Small group and big sound,"This was recorded for Verve in NYC on September 4, 1963. I am not sure how well it was received at the time, but like a fine wine it has aged nicely and is as relevant today as it was when released.<br /><br />It's one of my thrift store finds and shows a different side of Hodges. Actually, I may be stretching it because he was not only a versatile big band musician, but excelled in smaller ensembles. More importantly his work with Kenny Burrell and Wild Bill Davis actually contributed to soul and R&B in the 1960s.<br /><br />There is no track list as I write this so I am providing it:<br />A1 Jones 4:30<br />A2 I Cried For You 2:56<br />A3 Love You Madly 3:45<br />A4 Little John, Little John 3:58<br />B1 Stolen Sweets 3:05<br />B2 A & R Blues 6:43<br />B3 Lost In Meditation 3:14<br /><br />The music is more on the mellow side with beautiful guitar lines from Burrell and those beautiful B3 notes from Davis with a wonderful combination of sustained and staccato notes. The drummer is Ed Shaughnessy who plays with taste and is a perfect fit for this ensemble. Of course, Hodges' trademark, creamy alto sax is the centerpiece of each track.<br /><br />One interesting aspect is the contrast between Hodges and Davis, both of whom come from vastly different background - Hodges from Ellington's complex compositions and Davis from Louis Jordan's jump blues. They managed to create a synergy here and actually made eight albums together, so I am sure each influenced the other and brought something special to this album.",[],B004114U5K,B004114U5K,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-30 02:58:07.000,5,False,All Ages Will Enjoy This Book
5.0,Compilation of 2.5 albums,"I have owned this album for over five years, and also own the source albums. This is an odd mix, but all tracks feature Johnny Hodges and Kenny Burrell.<br /><br />Here are the albums that comprise this set:<br />Tracks 1 through 7 is the album titled [[ASIN:B004114U5K Mess of Blues LP]] that  was recorded for Verve in NYC on September 4, 1963. The music is more on the mellow side with beautiful guitar lines from Burrell and those beautiful B3 notes from Davis with a wonderful combination of sustained and staccato notes. The drummer is Ed Shaughnessy who plays with taste and is a perfect fit for this ensemble. Of course, Hodges' trademark alto sax is the centerpiece of each track.<br /><br />Tracks 8 through 10 are from that album titled [[ASIN:B00Q50W5ZC Johnny Hodges & Wild Bill Davis Blue Rabbit]] that was originally recorded for Verve in NYC spanning two 1963 and two 1964 sessions.  These tracks are from 1963. May 15, 1963 features Hodges on alto, Ray Jackson on organ, Kenny Burrell on guitar, Wendell Marshall on bass and Bobby Donaldson on drums for I Let A Song Go Out Of My Heart and Tangerine. On May 17, for the song Creole Love Call the same line-up performs, except Jack Lesberg is the bassist.<br /><br />The remaining tracks are the album titled [[ASIN:B0002ZEWPM Stride Right]] that was recorded for Verve in NYC on January 14, 1966. The line-up is Hodges on alto, Earl Hines on piano and a rhythm section that includes Kenny Burrell on guitar (who adds a LOT), Richard Davis on bass and Joe Marshall on drums.",[],B000OYCM3K,B000OYCM3K,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-08-31 16:15:13.000,1,False,A Son Remembers His Mother
5.0,A great reunion,"The only person lacking for this reunion (or sorts) is Ray Brown, which would have reunited the original line-up. Still, Sam Jones on bass does an excellent job, as does Bobby Durham on drums.<br /><br />Surprisingly this 38:35 minute album kicks off with a Wes Montgomery tune and Ellis comes across as Wes. The surprise is Ellis has a very distinct style, so I can only surmise that he was paying tribute to Wes. Again on track 3, a Charlie Christian composition, he sounds like Christian with the horn like style for which he was known. Another tribute perhaps?<br /><br />On this album Ellis is at the top of the mix, although Peterson's (and the rhythm section's) playing is distinct. Normally I prefer Peterson at the top, but here the mix is perfect for both the song selections and the overall sound. With respect to songs, Peterson's Blues for H.G. and Hampton Hawes' Hamp's Blues give Peterson some stretching room, while the remaining standards are more Ellis' territory (along with tracks 1 and 3, of course.)<br /><br />This album was recorded in just two days at the Hans Georg Brunner-Schwer Studio in Villingen, Germany for the MPS label on November 5 and 6, 1969. The sound is excellent and the music is equally so.",[],B000A69RIK,B000A69RIK,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-01 02:59:39.000,2,False,Great Explanations
5.0,Energetic and tight,"While I am torn between this edition of the trio with Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums,  and the earlier one where Herb Ellis on guitar instead of a drummer, this is probably the finest recorded performance by the Brown/Thigpen rhythm section. This is one of the four albums that were recorded live at the London House in Chicago on July 27 and 28, 1961.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples on this page to get a sense of not only the music and sound quality, but the energy and tightness of the trio: [[ASIN:B000VZMS8Q The Sound Of The Trio]].<br /><br />I have listened to this (and the entire [[ASIN:B00000473T London House Sessions]]) and hear and learn something different each time. As a musician myself I marvel at just how telepathically connected the trio is on this album. Of course part of the reason is Ray Brown had been with Peterson for a decade by the time this live performance was recorded. Add in the fact that Brown was well grounded in music theory and that accounts for the interplay between him and Peterson. However, Thigpen also brings something special to the ensemble. Not only was he one of the top brushmasters in jazz, but he was known as a very tasteful drummer. Like Brown he was well versed in theory and also composed and played piano. All three were intense musicians to begin with, but together they are synergistic on this album.<br /><br />A final note about the recording: I learned about some of what the engineer, Bruce Swedien, went through from his daughter who was there as a young girl. Swedien had to go from table to table trying to quiet people in the audience when taping this album. Also he spent his own money for the stereo tapes for the recordings because studio executives thought stereo was a gimmick. So while the trio is one key ingredient of some of this spectacular album, others made very real contributions to it as well.",[],B006A9XRU0,B006A9XRU0,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-02 20:41:49.000,10,False,For Those Who Doubt and Those Who Know
5.0,Perfect small group ensemble,"In my opinion this and [[ASIN:B000SZDMES Money Jungle]] both epitomize Duke's capabilities in small group settings. I tend to favor this one because it's true to his music. All of the tracks are his compositions except The Hawk Talks (and that was composed by Louie Bellson and performed with Ellington's orchestra.)<br /><br />Give the sound samples on the CD or MP3 page a listen to hear the music. This is classic Ellington with some amazing arrangements. In particular I was blown away by track 1 because I would have never guessed that a guitar could ever come close to Ben Webster's tenor sax for that tune (which Ellington wrote specifically for Webster.) Joe Pass pulls it off though.<br /><br />Indeed, every track is a masterpiece. Ray Brown on bass and Louie Bellson on drums are simply perfect as a rhythm section, and we also get glimpses of the Duke's incredible chops on piano. Need I even mention Joe Pass? This is actually my favorite over Money Jungle, which also had a dream line-up.<br /><br />This album was recorded for the Pablo label (successor to Verve) in a single session in Los Angeles on January 8, 1973. If you've never heard the Duke in a quarter, this is the place to start.",[],B000000XIQ,B000000XIQ,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-03 23:07:16.000,1,False,Positive Thoughts for a More Positive Life
5.0,Worthwhile live album,"This is one of my thrift shop finds and is an anniversary of sorts of the classic [[ASIN:B00CSW991O Complete Live at the Pershing Lounge 1958]]. That album was recorded in Chicago in January of 58 while this one was recorded live at NYC's Village Gate sometime in the spring of 68. I was unable to nail the exact dates because no discography seems to cite them. I do know that it was after March 1968 and before June of that year.<br /><br />The similarities end with the set list and the actually feel of the music. Since there is no track list as I write this, I am providing it:<br />A1 Have You Met Miss Jones 3:40<br />A2 Poinciana 9:08<br />A3 Lament 8:03<br />B1 Call Me 4:51<br />B2 Theme From Valley Of The Dolls 4:19<br />B3 Frank's Tune 5:31<br />B4 How Insensitive 5:55<br /><br />Total time is a few seconds over forty-two minutes. What distinguishes this album is Jamal's technique had evolved and his rhythm section. Jamal still used the incredible space and displayed his trademark penchant for playing in the high range of his piano (including his use of the highest G, A, B and C notes when he culd fit them into the music.) Bassist Jamil Sulieman and drummer Frank Gant on this album are discernibly different from Israel Crosby and Vernell Fournier who were on the Pershing Lounge album a decade earlier, so do not take my comments above to imply that this is a remake. It isn't. What it is, though, is a snapshot of Jamal in his long career and a showcase of his ever evolving talent.<br /><br />One final note: this album was produced for the Impulse! label by Johnny Pate, a renown Chicago bassist who had a very successful second career as a producer. His touch on this album adds to the magic.",[],B00Q525THG,B00Q525THG,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-04 11:42:20.000,6,False,Secrets to Beautiful Skin - Tips and Professional Skincare Products
5.0,Some hard to find albums,"All of the albums in this double disc set are winners in my opinion. Some are difficult to find, but all showcase Konitz' talents, which make this set near essential.<br /><br />The sound quality is very good. Not audiophile quality, but more than good enough for fans who want to dig into Konitz. There is virtually no information here so I am providing the tracks and source albums (and basic information) as follow:<br />========<br />DISC ONE<br />========<br />Tracks 1 through 9 are the album titled [[ASIN:B000QUCXRM With Strings / An Image]] that was recorded for Verve in NYC on February 6 and 8, 1958 and released the same year. There is a full orchestra backing Konitz, but there is also a core ensemble that is comprised of Konitz on alto sax, Gene Orloff on violin, Alan Shulman on cello, Lou Stein on piano and Billy Bauer on guitar. In particular, there are moments on this album where Konitz and Bauer are 'in the zone' that, alone, make this album worth owning. Bill Russo's arrangements (and conducting) also add a lot to the music. Tracks are:<br />1. `Round Midnight<br />2. The Daffodil's Smile<br />3. I Got It Bad<br />4. Music For Alto Saxophone And Strings, Part 1<br />5. Music For Alto Saxophone And Strings, Part 2<br />6. Music For Alto Saxophone And Strings, Part 3<br />7. What's New<br />8. Blues For Our Children<br />9. An Image Of Man, Parts 1-7<br />Tracks 10 through 16 are the album titled [[ASIN:B000WLIEGY You And Lee]] that was recorded in NYC for Verve on October 29 and 30, 1959.  The core ensemble is comprised of Konitz on alto sax accompanied by a trumpet section (Marky Markowitz, Ernie Royal, Phil Sunkel), a trombone section (Eddie Bert and Billy Byers, with Bob Brookmeyer on valve trombone), Bill Evans on piano on tracks 10 and 11, 13 and track 1 on DISC TWO, with Jim Hall on guitar on tracks 13, and 14 through 16, Sonny Dallas on bass and Roy Haynes on drums. Tracks are:<br />10. Ev'rything I've Got (Belongs To You)<br />11. You Don't Know What Love Is<br />12. You're Driving Me Crazy<br />13. I Didn't Know About You<br />14. You're Clear Out Of This World<br />15. The More I See You<br />16. You Are Too Beautiful<br />========<br />DISC TWO<br />========<br />Track 1 is a continuation of You and Lee:<br />1. I'm Getting Sentimental Over You<br />Tracks 2 through 11 are the album titled [[ASIN:B00CIM4IRE In Harvard Square]]. The first seven tracks were recorded for the Storyville label at an unspecified location and date other than Boston (presumably Harvard Square) in April 1954. Konitz and Ball are backed by Peter Ind on bass and Jeff Morton on drums. The final three tracks were also recorded in Boston - again, Harvard Square - in February 1955. Here the rhythm section is Percy Heath on bass and Al Levitt on drums. Tracks:<br />2. No Splice<br />3. She's Funny That Way<br />4. Time On My Hands<br />5. Foolin' Myself<br />6. Ronnie's Tune<br />7. Froggy Day<br />8. My Old Flame<br />9. If I Had You<br />10. Foolin' Myself<br />11. Ablution<br />The remaining tracks are the album titled [[ASIN:B0000015S1 Konitz]] that was recorded in New York and Boston in April, May and August of 1954. It features Konitz on alto backed by a superb rhythm section comprised of Ronnie Ball on piano, Peter Ind on bass and Jeff Morton on drums. Tracks 13 and 17 were recorded live at Storyville in Boston on August August 6, 1954, while the remainder of the tracks were recorded in the studio in April and May 1954 in New York. Tracks are:<br />12. Easy Livin'<br />13. Nursery Rhyme<br />14. Limehouse Blues<br />15. I'll Remember April<br />16. Skylark<br />17. Mean To Me<br />18. East 32nd<br />19.

5.0,"Hot, live perfomance","This album has only seven tracks, but clocks in at nearly 150 minutes. The sound quality is not spectacular, although not terrible either. It's the music that counts and this will not disappoint if you are an Art Pepper fan.<br /><br />First, there are no sound samples or a track list on the CD's page, but both are available on the digital album's page at [[ASIN:B005MVINUQ Live at Donte's, 1968]]. Go there and listen the samples, which are an accurate indication of both the sound quality and the music.<br /><br />I am not sure for whom or by whom this album was originally recorded, but I suspect that it was mastered from a private tape since there is no label other than Fresh Sounds listed. That label is a reissue label and one of the few that is keeping gems such as this alive.<br /><br />This was recorded at Donte's in Los Angeles on November 24, 1968.

5.0,A hidden gem among their prolific recordings,"If you are a Three Sounds (or Gene Harris) fan this will not disappoint. I was fortunate enough to find my copies in both CD and vinyl, and this CD is superior in sound to my used vinyl copy.<br /><br />Harris managed to include one of his own compositions (Parker's Pad), and also sprinkled a generous helping of Ellington and standards. I was surprised to find a Monk tune, Straight No chaser, and delighted to discover the John Lewis and Dizzy Gillespie collaboration titled Two Bass Hit. Lest I forget, Benny Golson's Blues After Dark is a real treat as well.<br /><br />The album clocks in at 38:51 and features the original Three Sounds line-up with Harris backed by Andrew Simpkins on bass and Bill Dowdy on drums. It was recorded for Bluenote at Rudy van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio in a single session on June 28, 1960.<br /><br />This is not what I would call an essential album, but if you come across a copy in reasonable condition I do recommend grabbing it if the price is right.

5.0,Bryant comes into his own,"This is Bryant's second album as a leader and his first leading just a trio (his inaugural album, [[ASIN:B0013AYWYQ Meet Betty Carter And Ray Bryant]], shared leader credits.)<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples here to get a sense of the music: [[ASIN:B000UB08A6 Ray Bryant Trio]]. Immediately you will hear Bryant in command of the trio and his playing is prominent in the mix. That is not a detraction of his sidemen, Ike Isaacs on bass and Charles 'Specs' Wright on drums because they are rock solid and make everything work. Indeed, they give Bryant the foundation and space he needs to stretch and show his stuff - and on this album he has plenty of chops to show.<br /><br />For me this is important because this album brings Bryant out of the shadows and allows his own playing to stand on its own merit. Another thing that makes this special is he was allowed to perform two of his own compositions - Blues Changes and Splittin' - which is uncommon for newly minted leaders. But Prestige did allow that and that was the perfect label for Bryant at that point in his career.<br /><br />This album was recorded at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on April 5, 1957. In my opinion it is essential for Bryant fans.",[],B00004TE0I,B00004TE0I,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-10 03:50:42.000,0,False,For Seekers of the Truth
5.0,Original album + 4 bonus tracks,"This was Golson's fourth album as a leader and of the ten tracks six are Golson's compositions. That he was a prolific composer goes without saying, but his playing on these tracks is not going to disappoint.<br /><br />Since there are sound samples on this page ([[ASIN:B000006Q66 Benny Golson And The Philadelphians]]), let those guide you because they convey a lot more about this album than I can describe in mere words.<br /><br />The line up on both the NYC session (the six tracks that were released on the original album), and the Paris session (the four bonus tracks) are some of the top musicians of their era.<br /><br />Tracks 1 through six were recorded at the Nola Penthouse Sound Studio in NYC in a single session on November 17, 1958. Golson is accompanied by fellow Jazz Messengers alumni Lee Morgan on trumpet and backed by a powerhouse rhythm section comprised of Ray Bryant on piano, Percy Heath on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums - all of whom hailed from Philadelphia. Of the six tracks, three are Golson's compositions with track 1 by Gigi Gryce, track 5 by John Lewis and track 6 by Ray Bryant.<br /><br />The bonus tracks were recorded in Paris on December 12, 1958 with Golson accompanied by Roger Guérin on trumpet, and backed by a rhythm section led by Jazz Messengers alumni Bobby Timmons on piano (and composer of Moanin'), the great Pierre Michelot on bass and Christian Garros on drums.<br /><br />If this album sounds like a Jazz Messengers release you are in good company because that's exactly how it sounds to my ears. Definitely recommended to Benny Golson fans.",[],B000006Q66,B000006Q66,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-10 04:29:16.000,0,False,Powerful Communication Secrets
5.0,Excellent mastering and sound quality and a valuable album for fans,"This is Bryant's third album as a leader and here he is both solo and focused on blues. All of the tracks except 3 (Lover Man) and 5 (Rockin' Chair) are his own compositions. At the time of my review there is no track list on this page. The tracks and their lengths are:<br />1. Blues No. 3 7:15<br />2. Joy (Blues No. 2) 3:59<br />3. Lover Man 3:52<br />4. Me and the Blues (Blues No. 1) 5:00<br />5. My Blues (Blues No. 5) 7:40<br />6. Rockin' Chair 5:16<br />7. Stocking Feet 4:47<br />The album clocks in at 37:49. Bryant is in excellent form as evidenced by the track samples on the digital album's page at [[ASIN:B000UBK02C Alone With The Blues]]. One thing is certain: Bryant can play the blues with the best of them (although Lover Man and Rockin' Chair are not technically blues numbers.)<br /><br />This album was originally recorded for Prestige's New Jazz label at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on December 19, 1958. It was released in 1959 and is what I consider to be an essential album for Bryant fans. His playing would continue to evolve, but the key to this album - for me - is the focus mainly on blues and his compositional skills. Of course, hearing him solo is yet another reason to grab this album.",[],B00F5AHFUS,B00F5AHFUS,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-10 06:34:35.000,0,False,Beautifully Illustrated
5.0,Timmons' first album as a leader,"While some of the playing is a bit uneven this is an essential album for Timmons fans because it was his first as a leader. The unevenness in my opinion comes from his performance of his main composition, Moanin'. It's a little stilted. In fact there are four of Timmons' compositions on the album: This Here, Moanin', Dat Dere and Joy Ride - almost half of the tracks.<br /><br />Timmons's stint as Art Blakey's musical director the the Jazz Messengers honed his arranging skills, which are also evident on this album. If you are on the CD's page, you can listen to sound samples here: [[ASIN:B00LT0EZ10 This Here Is Bobby Timmons]]. With the exception of the issues I noted about Moanin' the performances are solid and tight, both on Timmons' part and his excellent rhythm section (Sam Jones on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums). Also, I personally love his solo rendition of Billy Strayhorn's Lush Life. It shows Timmons' range as a pianist and a soloist, as well as his ability to interpret one of my favorite compositions. Also, his innate musical humor is evident throughout the album. Listen carefully and you will be rewarded.<br /><br />This album was recorded for the Riverside label at Reeves Sound Studios in NYC on January 13 and 14, 1960, and released the same year. If you are a Bobby Timmons fan this is essential. If you are just discovering him I still highly recommend this album.",[],B000000Y65,B000000Y65,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-10 09:47:26.000,0,False,A Cozy Chat About Insomnia
5.0,Rare Jazz Messengers,"This album started life as Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers - Selections From Lerner And Loewe's for RCA's Vik label, then morphed into Second Edition.<br /><br />The first six tracks are the Lerner And Loewe's session where a lesser known line-up of the Messengers performed that duo's hits. These were recorded in a single session at Webster Hall in NYC on March 13, 1957 by an ensemble comprised of Bill Hardman on trumpet and Johnny Griffin on tenor sax, backed by Sam Dockery on piano, Spanky DeBrest on bass and Blakey on drums.<br /><br />Tracks 7 through 9 were recorded at RCA's Studio 3 in NYC on April 2, 1957. This was a large line-up with both Messengers members and others: Bill Hardman and Lee Morgan on trumpet, Melba Liston on trombone, Sahib Shihab on alto sax, Johnny Griffin on tenor sax and Cecil Payne on baritone sax. The rhythm section was comprised of Wynton Kelly on piano, Spanky DeBrest on bass and Art Blakey on drums.<br /><br />Final two tracks were recorded in NYC on April 8, 1957 with Bill Hardman on trumpet and Johnny Griffin on tenor sax and Jackie McLean on alto sax. The rhythm section was comprised of Sam Dockery on piano, Spanky DeBrest on bass and Blakey on drums.<br /><br />This album is definitely off the beaten path for the Jazz Messengers, but the guest musicians add a lot to it. One of the main reasons to grab it is Bill Hardman who had a few stints with the Jazz Messengers, and is highly underrated. Of course, Griffin adds a lot, as do the members of the April 2 session.<br /><br />If you are a Jazz Messengers fan this is a rare treat. My favorite is the first six tracks, which adds to the uniqueness since I do not think the Messengers did a theme album before or since (although they did a French film score.)",[],B000002WU7,B000002WU7,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-10 19:48:55.000,1,False,Good Introduction to Insomnia
5.0,Interesting collaboration,"What makes this album interesting is Brubeck with good friend Bill Smith recorded an album that explores modal jazz (modes instead of chord progressions). It's tempting to think that Brubeck was inspired by Miles Davis, but bear in mind that Smith was the driving force behind this musical direction. Indeed, he composed (or co-composed) all of the tracks. The interesting part is Brubeck's music direction was improvising in different time signatures, so when this collaboration came about he took a slight detour.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples on this page ([[ASIN:B000000YB9 Brubeck A La Mode, Featuring Bill S]]) to get a sense of the music. Don't be immediately put off because the sound samples capture only a snippet. The ensemble is the Quartet (Brubeck, Gene Wright on bass and Joe Morello on drums) minus Paul Desmond's alto sax. Smith fills in for Desmond on all but Soliloquy, which is a duet between Brubeck and Wright.<br /><br />Smith's clarinet is mostly in the lower register. In some places he reminded me of Eric Dolphy on bass clarinet. Of course, the main difference if you are a DBQ fan is not the clarinet in lieu of alto, but the modal approach to each track. If you like Miles Davis' Kind of Blue you will probably like this.<br /><br />For me the highlight is Soliloquy, but I spend most of my professional life locked in with a bassist or pianist, so I am naturally drawn to that track.  To be totally honest, although I love Kind of Blue and its modal approach this album took some time for me to dig in and truly appreciate it. Perhaps it's because I have always considered Desmond to be the soul of the quartet.<br /><br />That brings the question as to why Desmond wasn't there. Brubeck and Desmond each had a deal with Columbia that they could record on specific occasions with another label (in Brubeck's case he was allowed to record an album a year) as long as the entire quartet was not involved. Since Desmond had essentially the same deal he sat this one out and Brubeck and his good friend Smith, plus Wright and Morello made this album.<br /><br />The album was recorded in NYC in May and June, 1960 for the Fantasy label. The same line-up would record another album for Fantasy ([[ASIN:B000000YD9 Near-Myth]]) in March 1961, but this one is somewhat groundbreaking. To be sure this is not my favorite Brubeck album, but honestly ranks high as interesting and even intriguing.",[],B000000YB9,B000000YB9,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-10 20:41:48.000,2,False,Spiritually Comforting - 52 Short Devotionals with Questions
5.0,Great album with the Cook-Mitchell quintet,"This is the third album with the Junior Cook/Blue Mitchell line-up, and the first that features Roy Brooks on drums (the previous drummer in that line-up was Louis Hayes.)<br /><br />The music is not exactly hard bop (although it still fits that genre more than any other). There is Silver's characteristic soulfulness and penchant for complex rhythms. The best way to get a flavor of the music is to listen to sound samples (they are on this page: [[ASIN:B000T1HOGI Horace - Scope]]).<br /><br />Listening to the samples you can clearly hear how Silver is content to let Junior Cook's tenor sax and Blue Mitchell's trumpet dominate. That is not to say that Silver is just comping along. He definitely makes his presence known when it's musically appropriate, but his approach is more to get his musical ideas across using teamwork more than a focus on himself. His rhythm section - Gene Taylor on bass and Roy Brooks on drums - are perfect for this ensemble. I will admit that I like the contributions that drummer Hayes made in the earlier quintet line-up, but Brooks is also a good fit for this incarnation.<br /><br />This album was recorded for Blue Note at Rudy van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio in two sessions (July 8 and 9, 1960). Interestingly all of the tracks are Silver's compositions except for Without You.",[],B00CBLZSZI,B00CBLZSZI,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-12 05:35:10.000,2,False,Dealing with the Inevitable
5.0,There aren't enough superlatives ...,"I've been on a Tad Dameron kick lately and among all of his recorded albums as a leader this one stands out. First, the line-up is so perfectly matched to the music that one wonders if there had been any changes would the music even come close to what was recorded that November day. Of course, the fact that the entire album was laid down in a single session is another remarkable feature by today's standards. Back them it was common for jazz musicians to walk in and leave the same day with a complete album, often to be released the same year.<br /><br />But I digress. Listen to the sound samples on this page. One thing that leaps out is Coltrane is given all of the space he needs or wants, and there are some iconic tracks. My favorite is Soultrane, but that reflects my personal taste. Another thing is all of the tracks are Dameron compositions, which makes it valuable to musicians who want to dissect his approach to not only composing, but arranging. Both are exemplified on every track.<br /><br />Finally, it's the music itself. Coltrane's tenor sax may be given a lot of space, but the backing musicians seem to be mentally connected to one another in a way that shows they are familiar with each other. Indeed, drummer Philly Joe Jones was so inspired by Dameron that he formed a tribute group later in his own career. On this album Jones' drumming is a study in brushwork on many of the tracks, and a study in taste on all of them. In my opinion bassist John Simmons also significantly contributed. His approach is straightforward on each track, and provides the perfect pulse on all of them to move the music without adorning it with unnecessary notes.<br /><br />This was recorded for  Prestige at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on November 30, 1956. To be honest, I have not met a mid 1950s Prestige album by anyone that I didn't like, but this one stands out for the reasons I've outlined above.",[],B000OLHG5W,B000OLHG5W,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-15 13:20:56.000,9,False,Good Advice for Newbies
5.0,Invaluable live recordings of a solid ensemble led by Navarro,"This album is a collection of radio broadcasts of live performances between August and October 1948 from the Royal Roost in NYC. The core ensemble is comprised of Fats Navarro on trumpet, Rudy Williams on alto sax and Allen Eager on tenor sax. The rhythm section is Tadd Dameron on piano, Curly Russell on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums. Depending on the performance there are additional musicians.<br /><br />The remarkable feature of this track list is all but three of the songs are Dameron compositions. The three that are not are Gershwin's Lady Be Good, Bird's Anthropology and Navarro's Eb-Pob.<br /><br />Since there is no track list at the time of this review I am going to provide it for reference:<br />1. Good Bait (No.1)<br />2. Lady Be Good<br />3. Anthropology<br />4. The Squirrel<br />5. Tadd Walk<br />6. Dameronia<br />7. Our Delight<br />8. Eb-Pob<br />9. Good Bait (No.2)<br />10.Symphonette<br />11.The Squirrel (No.2)<br /><br />If you are familiar with Narvarro's playing circa 1948, and especially with both Dameron and Clarke, you have a general sense of what the music is all about. Sadly there are no sound samples, but this is live Navarro with a killer rhythm section. The sound quality is more than respectable considering these recordings are from broadcasts, and made using nearly seventy year old equipment and methods.<br /><br />Tracks 1 through 3 were recorded from an August 29, 1948 performance featuring the core ensemble.<br /><br />I could not nail down when track 4 was recorded, so have to leave a question mark. If you know, please a comment.<br /><br />Tracks 5 and 6 were recorded by the ensemble (plus Chano Pozo on bongos) on October 9, 1948.<br /><br />Tracks 7 through 9 and 11 were recorded on October 23, 1948, with additional personnel augmenting the core ensemble (Kai Winding on trombone, Milt Jackson on vibraphone and Chano Pozo on bongos).<br /><br />Track 10 was recorded on September 4, 1948 with the core ensemble plus Milt Jackson on vibraphone.<br /><br />If you are a Navarro (or Dameron) fan it goes without saying that this is an essential album. Or in my opinion, anyway. Navarro did not leave behind a huge body of recorded work, so any recording featuring him is a gem. Dameron was much more recorded, but in addition to his genius on piano, the compositions on this album using his arrangements and leadership in the rhythm section make this essential too. Here we can hear his compositions performed as he envisioned.",[],B000050UNY,B000050UNY,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-15 20:27:43.000,0,False,Useful Information
5.0,Great tribute and high energy live performance,"Monk ranks among my top three pianists, so I had to have this loving tribute (and it truly is.) Actually, only the first four tracks are Monk compositions. The other three are Django, which was composed my pianist John Lewis (with whom Jackson spent most of his career in the Modern Jazz Quartet), Think Positive, which Jackson composed and Blues For Groundhog, which is a ray brown composition.<br /><br />Since there are no sound samples at the time of this review I will cite my favorite track: 'Round Midnight, which is mainly Ray Brown playing the melody on bowed bass and Monty Alexander tastefully comping behind him on piano. It's probably one of the most beautiful renditions I have ever heard. Or, perhaps, it just touched me in a special way. Regardless, the entire album is one musical surprise after the other, and most of it is at bright tempos where the entire ensemble shines.<br /><br />Jackson is truly a master on vibraphone, but so are the others in their respective instruments. I was surprised by the restraint Alexander displayed because his style is given to 'excursions' and quoting within melodies. Here is sticks to the arrangements. That is not to say he was subdued in any way - that is not in his nature. Ray Brown and Mickey Roker were perfect for rounding out the rhythm section.<br /><br />This entire album was recorded for the Pablo label at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London on April 28, 1982. I have a number of albums that were recorded live in that venue, including ones featuring Anita O'Day, Oscar Peterson and Chet Baker. Among them, this is probably my favorite because the quartet was on fire.",[],B000000Z18,B000000Z18,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-16 01:22:26.000,1,False,Inspirational Stories
5.0,Interesting tracks that take an abrupt turn,"I'm listening to this album as I write this (pulled it out for just that purpose.) I don't own many of Byrd's albums, but even so this one is unique in that it starts our pensive for three tracks, then moves to a completely different feel.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples and you will hear the abrupt change that I mention. You will also get a feel for the music and sound quality, both of which are excellent to my ears.<br /><br />Tracks 1 through 3 are in essence a medley that features Byrd forward in the mix, subtly backed by Keter Betts on bass and Buddy Deppenschmidt on drums. The bass and drums are so far under the music that it sounds almost like Byrd playing solo on an acoustic. In addition to starting the album with a completely different feel, these tracks are all Byrd's compositions.<br /><br />The remaining tracks are all standards, and the ensemble changes with Barry Harris on piano joining the trio. Harris is an interesting choice in that he is steeped in bebop and heavily influenced by Tadd Dameron. None of that is evident here, but his playing is impeccable for the music. Although I am a big fan of Harris, I think D.C. icon Dick Morgan would have been a better choice. For one thing he had a history with Betts and Deppenschmidt, as well as Byrd. Of course, that is just me musing out loud because Harris is a great fit here.<br /><br />This album was actually first released by the Washington Offbeat label. However, according to discographies I have checked, was recorded for Riverside in NYC on October 23, 1961 (tracks 4 through 7) and October 24, 1961 (tracks 1 through 3).",[],B00005J6XR,B00005J6XR,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-16 13:29:59.000,1,False,Beautifully Designed
4.0,Excellent recordings that are difficult to track down,"This is a collection of Baker's live performances that are not documented (which is why I docked it a star.)<br /><br />The sound quality is good-to-very good, and the performances are obviously cherry picked because each track has energy and superb musicianship.  I was surprised by some of the fire exhibited by Baker on tracks like Milestones, and on those on which he sings, like Deep in a Dream, his voice is strong and melodic. In fact, I have listened to a large number of his live performances and they are hit or miss. The tracks in this album all seem to hit.<br /><br />Tracking down the sources of each track has proven difficult, but after hours of listening and researching here is what I have (and I cannot guarantee total accuracy:<br /><br />Track 1 sounds like a June 9, 1963 performance in Paris with Baker backed  by Georges Arvanitas on piano, Guy Pedersen on bass and Daniel Humair on drums.<br /><br />Tracks 2, 4 and 5 appear to be from a July 24, 1975 performance in Nice, France with Baker accompanied and backed by Bob Mover on alto sax, Kenny Drew on piano, Larry Ridley on bass and David Lee on drums.<br /><br />Track 3 is the closest match I could find to a 1976 performance in Rome with Baker plus Jacques Pelzer on flute, Harold Danko on piano and Isla Eckinger on bass. I may be incorrect on this one, but cannot find any other performance that is a better match.<br /><br />Tracks 6 and 7 sound like they are from a  July 20, 1975 performance in Nice, France. Baker is backed by Larry Ridley on bass and Ray Mosca on drums.<br /><br />This is certainly not an essential Chet Baker album, but does have some examples of his more lucid live playing between the early 1960s to mid 1970s in Europe. Of course, that's assuming that I've correctly identified the source performance for each track. Even if I am wrong about those, the music stands on its own merit.<br />live in Nice, France,",[],B000006K8V,B000006K8V,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-17 15:47:26.000,4,False,A Great Guide for Your Next Vacation
5.0,Three Ps make magic,"The combination of Peterson, Pass and Pedersen is potent when it comes to music. This is one of the strongest drummerless Peterson trios since Ray Brown and Herb Ellis were members, and the sound samples on this page convey just that.<br /><br />One of the things that give this particular live performance synergy is Joe Pass is uncharacteristically aggressive in his playing. Most of the recordings I own featuring him showcase an introspective approach to playing. His usual mode is to use his virtuoso chops and inventive mind to craft laid back, musically beautiful lines. Here is is on fire.<br /><br />Part of the magic is also due to Oscar Peterson's pyrotechnics, and Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen's own virtuosity on bass that matches Oscar's every note. Again, the sound samples will give you a glimpse of what I am trying to describe, but there is nothing like listening to the entire album.<br /><br />One other point: this is a fairly short album, even by 1973 standards when it was recorded. It clocks in at slightly less than thirty eight and a half minutes. However, each track is so intensely performed that it seems a lot longer.<br /><br />The fact that this is live is clearly evident in the crown noise and interaction. That adds to the ambiance of the music on one hand, but there are moments when I wish they would shut up and enjoy the extraordinary performance.<br /><br />This was recorded live for the Pablo label at the London House in Chicago on  May 16 through 19, 1973. There was another track recorded during this period (Reunion Blues) that was used in an album titled Oscar Peterson - History Of An Artist, Vol. 2, and there were other tracks during May performances of the trio at the venue that were released as [[ASIN:B000000YTG The Good Life]].",[],B00000DFI7,B00000DFI7,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-20 14:37:44.000,8,False,"A Book for Scientists, Philosphers and Mathematicians"
5.0,On par with the Peterson/Ellis/Brown line up,"I am not seriously going to compare this edition of the trio with the 50s one featuring Herb Ellis and Ray Brown. However, I will say that I personally enjoy this album as much as any the earlier trio recorded.<br /><br />This one was recorded at the London House in Chicago during the same period as [[ASIN:B00000DFI7 The Trio]]. The only key difference between the two albums are the track titles. If you run through the sound samples on this page you will hear what I mean when I say that the performances are intense.<br /><br />As with the other album, Joe Pass' guitar work is more aggressive that his usual, virtuoso - but laid back - style. Perhaps it's Peterson's own drive, combined with Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen's bass that is locked into Peterson that account for it. I do have to note that Pedersen's bass work is perfectly matched to the music on each track.<br /><br />Again, comparing this to The Trio mentioned above the song selection on this album gives it a slightly different feel than the other one. I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite track from this particular album, but as I write this it would probably be On A Clear Day. To me that track gives Peterson, Pass and Pedersen more room to stretch out as well as interact with one another.<br /><br />Regardless of which track would be your favorite, if you are a fan of any or all of the members of this trio this album is worth grabbing.",[],B000000YTG,B000000YTG,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-09-20 14:41:17.000,1,False,How to React to Cancer Issues in Families
5.0,Serendipity (and some great music),"I discovered this album when I was researching Dunlop's brother Frankie who is one of my drumming inspirations. While Boyd never received the recognition that Frankie did, he is credited with teaching him (at least initially), and they share a common style.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples on this page and you will hear a lot of space in Boyd Dunlop's playing. His style is similar in some ways to Ahmad Jamal's who is the master of space and making every note count. Brother Frankie's drum playing is the same, so there has to be a connection there.<br /><br />As you listen to the sound samples you will get hints of his concertizing too. That adds a nice layer of nuance on top of relatively simple blues compositions, but the space is still there. That is what I love about this album.<br /><br />Of course, there is the back story, but other reviews have covered that. Read them because when I mentioned serendipity in the title, I meant it on many levels.<br /><br />This was recorded in Buffalo, NY in February 2011 at the Magic Shop studio with Dunlop backed by Sabu Adeyola on bass and Virgil Day on drums. As good as Dunlop is, both Adeyola and Day add a lot to the music too.

5.0,If you have the original get this anyway,"There are a number of reviews that discuss the back story of this reissue so I will spare you another recitation.<br /><br />Here is why this is worth every penny even if you own the original release: the sound quality of the original concert and the additional tracks that comprise the entire concert are vastly superior to the original. If you do own the original the differences in sound is startling. The first two discs are the original concert as heard at the September 19, 1955 concert, including announcements. The third is the original album with greatly enhanced sound and speed correction.<br /><br />Even with the corrections, though, the piano Garner was playing is slightly out of tune in the higher registers. That cannot be corrected.<br /><br />However, both bassist Eddie Calhoun and drummer Denzil Best are in their proper place in the mix versus being barely audible on the original recording and release. I did hear one Garner technique that I missed on the original release when he employed contrary motion on a track. It was jaw dropping - but all of his playing is.<br /><br />A favorite track for me is the interview at the end of Disc Three. For once I was able to hear his actual voice instead of his trademark grunts on just about every album of his that I own. In a way it was like a mini oral history. But the heart and soul is the music. At the time of this review there are no sound samples on this page.

5.0,Great feel and authentic adaptation of Latin rhythms,"I've owned a copy of this album in one format or another for decades. While this would not classify as ritmo caliente (hot rhythm), having Candido on congas joining Wyatt Ruther on bass and Gene Heard on drums, makes this authentic. And Candido adds a lot heat and spice when the music calls for them.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples on this page for a hint of the music. While Garner penned Mambo Garner, Mambo Nights and Mambo blues, it's his adaptation of Cole Porter's Begin the Beguine that is a standout. At least to me. Garner did do all of the arrangements, and in my opinion did them all justice. I am sure Candido had input, and certainly his conga playing influenced each track.<br /><br />This album was recorded for Mercury at the Fine Sound Studios in NYC in July 1954. On an original LP's liner notes it alludes to the album being recorded at Chicago's Universal Recording, but every discography I have cross checked say NYC. That is not as important as the music, which is excellent here. It's something of a departure from Garner's normal fare, but his playing contains his signature sound.<br /><br />While this is not an essential Garner album, but is one any fan will enjoy.

5.0,Proof that he did not sell out,"The significance of this album is it brought Nat back to his jazz roots. By 1957 when he recorded this album he was better known for his popular music, while many fans lamented the fact that he was no longer playing jazz.<br /><br />This album dispelled any doubts that he was - first and foremost - a jazz musician. It also reinforced his reputation as a virtuoso pianist instead of a vocalist who happened to play piano. What I love about this 1957 album are his return to jazz, albeit a short one, and the fairly large ensemble.<br /><br />While Nat's popular songs entailed groups of similar sizes, they were not necessarily comprised of big name jazz musicians.  In come cases his popular recordings were backed by studio musicians who would play anything on charts placed in front of them. This group is different. Aside from Nat on piano, the musicians include Harry Sweets Edison on trumpet, Willie Smith on alto, Juan Tizol on trombone, Stuff Smith on violin, and a rhythm section comprised of Charlie Harris on bass, Lee Young on drums, John Collins on guitar and Jack Costanzo on bongos. A side note: Tizon composed Caravan (on the album) with Ellington, and Lee Young is Lester Young's brother. For those who do not know, Lester started out as a drummer himself.<br /><br />This album is a gem on many levels, but the main value is we can hear that Nat lost nothing from the amazing abilities he displayed in his trio and Jazz At The Philharmonic years.

Compared to the other Eastwood produced album, this one features some of the cast from the title movie, including Eastwood himself, his daughter Alison and Kevin Spacey. To be honest, Clint is not the best vocalist in the world, but his taste in music is impeccable. I was pleasantly surprised by Spacey, and was expecting Alison's performance since she was cast in the role as a jazz vocalist in the movie.<br /><br />The sound samples on this page tell a complete story about the music and performances on this album. I also own multiple albums by some of the performers like Diana Krall, Rosemary Clooney and Tony Bennett. This album also introduced me to Brad Mehldau whose rendition of Dream instantly made me a fan.<br /><br />This and the aforementioned album are some of the best evidence of Mercer's genius as a lyricist.

The other two tracks are from a live performance at the Prelude Club  in NYC on October 2, 1959 and have the same line-up except Jimmy Rowser on bass.<br /><br />It's actually difficult to tell the studio tracks from the live ones because of the high energy. If you are familiar with Garland's trios this will not disappoint.

In fact, all of the albums from which these tracks are drawn were recorded in Rudy van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio, and the represent Hancock's first, second, fourth and fifth albums.

It was recorded on June 17, 1964 and features Hancock accompanied by Freddie Hubbard on cornet, Ron Carter on bass and Tony Williams on drums.<br /><br />Watermelon Man and Driftin' are from his first album as a leader titled Takin' Off that was recorded on May 28, 1962. Hancock is accompanied by Freddie Hubbard on trumpet, Dexter Gordon on tenor sax, Butch Warren on bass and Billy Higgins on  drums.<br /><br />Blind Man and And What If I Don't are from his second album as leader titled My Point of View that was recorded on March 19, 1963. Hancock is accompanied by Donald Byrd on trumpet, Grachan Moncur on trombone, Hank Mobley on tenor sax, Grant Green on guitar, Chuck Israels on bass and Tony Williams on drums.<br /><br />The final track is from his fifth album of the same name, Maiden Voyage, that was recorded on March 17, 1965.

5.0,Collette showcased in 2-album set,"One of these albums features Collette as co-leader (with Chico Hamilton), and the other has him as a sideman on an album led by drummer Max Albright. Both have a distinct west coast flavor, but the Albright tracks sound like Glenn Miller meets west coast jazz. Both albums were recorded for Capitol Los Angeles on the fall of 1956.<br /><br />The two albums are dramatically different from one another, so I am going to link to the source albums, both of which contain sound samples. You can get an idea of the music by running through those.<br /><br />The first ten tracks are the album titled [[ASIN:B000R00B20 Tanganyika]]. If you are familiar with Chico Hamilton's work during the mid 1950s, then you have a good idea about the arrangements and music. It's basically chamber jazz. This album was recorded on September 16 and 27, 1956, and features a front line comprised of John Anderson on trumpet and Collette alternating among flute, clarinet, and alto and tenor sax. The rhythm section is Gerry Wiggins on piano, Jim Hall on guitar, Curtis Counce on bass and Chico Hamilton on drums.<br /><br />The remaining twelve tracks are the album titled [[ASIN:B001V5UDZU Mood For Max]] that was recorded on November 8, 16 and 23, 1956.

5.0,Great talent with solid arrangements and backing,"I inadvertently discovered this album when I was looking up various renditions of Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Halie Loren popped up in the search, and my interest was piqued. A search turned up this album, which I devoured.<br /><br />What I love is the eclectic mix of tracks ranging from R&B and rock, to standards. But the most impressive part is three of Loren's own compositions are included. Most jazz vocalists play it safe and stick to standards. She (and undoubtedly her producer) has enough confidence to include her compositions along with non-jazz songs. Her material is the title track plus How Should I Know and I Don't Miss It That Much.<br /><br />Her backing ensemble is also excellent - Tim McLaughlin on trumpet,  backed by Matt Treder on piano, Mark Schneider on bass and Brian West on drums (and other percussion.) Each track is tight and the arrangements are perfect. For example, on Autumn Leaves, it's just Treder and Loren. If you are a musician you know a duo like that on an album takes both chops and self confidence.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples on this page to get an idea of the music, Loren's voice, and the panorama of musical styles this album contains. I would hate to have to name a single favorite track, but I will say that tracks 3, 4, 8 and 13 are ones that I often relisten when I play this album.

3.0,For hard core fans. Sound quality is not perfect,"I managed to find this gem in a local thrift shop in pristine condition. Historically, the music has value. However, even in pristine condition the sound quality is not perfect (to say the least). However, since these were personal recordings by amateurs using 1950 technology one can forgive that. For me it's the casual setting and historical value. To someone wanting professionally recorded tracks of Bird the sound may be disappointing.<br /><br />Here is the track listing for the album:<br />A1  Little Willie Leaps<br />A2  All The Things You Are<br />A3  Bernie's Tune<br />A4  Donna Lee<br />A5  Out Of Nowhere<br />B1  Half Nelson<br />B2  Fine And Dandy<br />B3  Half Nelson<br />B4  Cherokee<br />B5  Scrapple From The Apple<br />B6  Star Eyes<br /><br />It clocks in at a little over 48 minutes, and was released by the Zim label. All of the tracks were recorded in a private residence (the William Henry Apartment at 136th. Street and Broadway in NYC), and the recordings took place on June 4, 11 and possibly the 18th or 25th, 1950.<br /><br />Tracks A1 through B2 feature Parker and Joe Maini on alto sax,  Jimmy Knepper on trombone, Jon Eardley and Norma Carson on trumpet, and Bob Newman and Gers Yowell on tenor sax. The rhythm section was John Williams on piano (at least on tracks A1 through A5), Buddy Jones on bass, and drummers Phil Brown (tracks A1, A4, B1 and B2), Frank Isola (tracks A2 and A5), and  Buddy Bridgeford (track A3).<br /><br />The remaining tracks feature Parker and Maini on alto sax, Jimmy Knepper on trombone,  John Nielson on trumpet and  Don Lanphere on tenor sax.

5.0,My favorite line-up and a solid album,"I've always loved Garland's playing and personally love his Prestige years with Paul Chambers on bass and Art Taylor on bass. This album also has Kenny Burrell on guitar on tracks 3 and 7, so there is an extra reason to love this album.<br /><br />Since there are sound samples on this page, run through those and let them convey the essence of this album. Granted, the tracks are fairly common fare for circa 1957 piano jazz trios, but there are some gems. I'd be hard pressed to pick any one or two tracks as favorites. I will say that the two that feature Burrell are darn good and make me wish that the entire album included him.<br /><br />Paul Chambers and Art Taylor rate highly in my personal opinion because they are the perfect rhythm section for Garland. All three are near telepathic (and not only on this album) among each other. I like Chambers because he creates a pulse, which is evident on every track, and Taylor because he never overplays. His grooves are tasteful and well matched to each arrangement.<br /><br />This album was recorded for Prestige in Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio in a single session on May 24, 1957. That's another reason why I love the album - it has the spontaneity that can only be achieved with all of the musicians walk into the studio at the same time and lay down track after track in a single day. Contrast that with how music is recorded today.",[],B000007S97,B000007S97,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-06 17:21:26.000,2,False,Exercise and Diet
5.0,Nicely done live set,"One of the reasons why I rated this so highly is the sound quality is better than the other copies of this album that I've worn out over the years.<br /><br />If you are a Hampton Hawes fan in particular you are going to enjoy the album. However, these is so much more on the scant 37:44 minute album that makes it special. For one thing, it may have a lot of Los Angeles musicians, but Sweets Edison on trumpet and Joe Turner's two vocals on Feelin' Happy and Shake, Rattle and Roll give a nice Kansas City flavor. In fact, that may be why I love this album so much - the admixture of West Coast and KC give it a sound and vibe that are unique. The rest of the line-up includes Sonny Criss on alto sax, Teddy Edwards on tenor sax, Leroy Vinnegar on bass and Bobby Thompson on drums.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples on this page for a taste of the music. If you have a multi-region DVD player you can also watch this concert on [[ASIN:B00024IQF0 Sonny Criss & the L.A. All-Stars/The Les McCann Trio: In Concert]]. The sound is not as good on the DVD, but seeing this concert is a treat.<br /><br />This was actually recorded (and filmed) live at the Memory Lane Steakhouse in Los Angeles for a TV program called Jazz on Stage. I was unable to dig up the exact date other than circa 1970.",[],B000A1CSN6,B000A1CSN6,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-11 12:23:39.000,3,False,Beautiful Artwork
5.0,Two great Los Angeles concerts,"The video quality is not the best, nor is the sound, but I rated this five stars because of some of the rare footage. Both clips totaling about fifty-six minutes were filmed in 1970. I was unable to establish exact dates for either.<br /><br />The first four tracks were filmed at the Memory Lane Steakhouse in Los Angeles for a TV program called Jazz on Stage. The tracks are:<br />1. Memory Lane Blues<br />2. Feeling Happy<br />3. Shake, Rattle & Roll<br />4. Teddy's Blues<br /><br />What makes this part of the DVD special is the very rare footage of Sonny Criss. I have a lot of him on audio, but not much on video. Also, while the line-up is packed with Los Angeles stars, Sweets Edison on trumpet and Joe Turner's two vocals on Feelin' Happy and Shake, Rattle and Roll give a nice Kansas City flavor. Finally, it's always a treat to see and hear bassist Leroy Vinnegar in action (not to mention Hawes on piano, Teddy Edwards on tenor sax and Bobby Thompson on drums.)<br /><br />Segment number two was filmed the same year at Shelly Manne's Manne Hole in Los Angeles. This one features Les McCann - a personal favorite of mine - in a trio setting backed by Jimmy Rowser on bass and Donald Dean on drums. Their set comprised:<br />1. Right On<br />2. Sunny<br />3. With These Hands<br />4. Compared to What<br /><br />For me it's a coin toss as to which of the two segments are my favorites. I love the unique blend of West Coast and Kansas City of the All Star set,  but McCann and his trio are high energy and definitely a highlight.<br /><br />A few notes: this particular DVD requires a multi-region player. Second, you can listen to sound samples of the All Star set from a CD made from it here: [[ASIN:B000A1CSN6 Live at Memory Lane 1970]].",[],B00024IQF0,B00024IQF0,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-11 12:52:45.000,0,False,Tips for a Healthier Life
5.0,"A rare find, but five stars only if you are a jazz geek","I stumbled across this album looking for Hampton Hawes' tracks. Since I am also a huge Mingus fan I was surprised that I had not come across it before.<br /><br />Basically, this collaboration is interesting from the arrangements and the chemistry among Hawes on one side and Mingus-Richmond on the other. There always was a telepathy between Mingus and Richmond, but on this album it seems to have extended to Hawes.<br /><br />One of the other reasons why I love this album is the arranging is different. Summertime, for example, is unlike any rendition that I have ever heard. It definitely has Mingus' imprint, but Dannie Richmond's approach on drums is what sets it apart. Hawes is not diminished in the least, though - he is like the glue that holds it together. In fact, that appears to be his role throughout this album.<br /><br />Note that Hawes is not on I Can't Get Started. For some reason Sonny Clark is on piano on that one. It's not a matter of availability because all of the tracks were recorded in a single July 9, 1957 session in NYC for the Jubilee label.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are a Hampton Hawes or Charles Mingus fan this album is worth checking out. It definitely has the Mingus touch, but Hawes asserts himself too.",[],B000005H9N,B000005H9N,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-11 14:09:57.000,2,False,Relaxing
5.0,More than just 1956 studio sessions,"While most of the tracks in this set are from 1956 studio sessions for Columbia, there are some tracks that are from as early as 1957. The bulk of the tracks are from a June 7, 1956 marathon session that was recorded - incredibly - in a day. Some accounts cite three and a half hours.<br /><br />I've linked to the source albums, all of which have sound samples to run through.<br /><br />The title album, [[ASIN:B0048W5S8A The Most Happy Piano]], is comprised of the following tracks: DISC ONE Tracks 2, 4  6, 7, 8 and 12. DISC TWO tracks 6 (full title is Mambo 207), 7 and 8. All of the tracks were recorded for Columbia at their 30th Street studios in NYC on June 7, 1956 and September 11, 1956. The line up is This album features Garner backed by bassist Al Hall and drummer Specs Powell.<br /><br />The next album, [[ASIN:B0054ODHRU The One And Only]], is comprised of the following tracks: DISC ONE: Tracks 1, 5, 9, 10, 11 and 13. DISC TWO: Track 10. These are from the same June 7, 1956 session as the title album.<br /><br />The remaining tracks are from an out-of-print album titled He's Here! He's Gone! He's Garner! and [[ASIN:B0155OZ00U Encores In Hi Fi]], which were mainly from the June 7, 1956 session, but some were also recorded between 1950 and 1956. Complete details ad sound samples are provided in my review of the linked album.<br /><br />This is a great collection of Garner's mid 1950s work (including some from the early 1950s.)

5.0,Brownie with excellent accompanient and backed by great rhythm sections,"This two album set that was compiled from two 1953 Blue Note sessions, and released in 1956 by Blue Note after Brown's death.<br /><br />A run through the sound samples on this page reveal some excellent music (and sound quality). For me one major plus is having Elmo Hope on piano on nine track, and the seeds of the Modern Jazz Quartet on the other nine.<br /><br />The first nine tracks are the out-of-print album titled Donaldson/Clifford Brown New Faces-New Sounds. They were recorded for Blue Note at the WOR Studios in NYC, June 9, 1953 and feature Brown on trumpet and Lou Donaldson on alto sax as the front line, with a rock solid rhythm section led by Elmo Hope on piano, Percy Heath on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums.<br /><br />Tracks 10 through 18 are the out-of-print album titled New Star on the Horizon that was recorded for Blue Note at Audio-Video Studios in NYC on August 28, 1953. The front line on this album features Brown on trumpet, Gigi Gryce on alto sax and flute, and Charlie Rouse on tenor sax. The rhythm section is John Lewis on piano, Percy Heath on bass and Art Blakey on drums.<br /><br />In my opinion every Clifford Brown fan should own this set.

5.0,Brownie meets the West Coast school,"This album is evidence of of how Brown could fit into any ensemble, be it the East Coast sound or the competing West Coast. This album is the latter and you would have never guessed that Brown came up in Philadelphia and NYC.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples to get a flavor of the album. Considering that the tracks were recorded over sixty years ago using relatively crude technology and techniques the sound quality is excellent. The musicianship even more so.<br /><br />This album was recorded for the Pacific Jazz label at the Capitol Studios in Los Angeles. Daahoud, Joy Spring, Bones For Jones and Tiny Capers are Brown's own compositions. Finders Keepers is a Jack Montrose composition (he was also the arranger for all of the tracks on this album.)<br /><br />The first three tracks were recorded on July 12, 1954 with Brown accompanied by  Zoot Sims on tenor sax, Stu Williamson on valve trombone and Bob Gordon on baritone sax. They are backed by a rhythm section led by Russ Freeman on piano,  Joe Mondragon on bass and Shelly Manne on drums.<br /><br />All of the remaining tracks were recorded on August 13, 1954 using the same line up except Carson Smith replaces Joe Mondragon on bass.",[],B00005MIZ7,B00005MIZ7,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-13 23:32:48.000,2,False,A Positive Message
5.0,Hard bop seasoned with Latin,"The musicianship on each track is what one comes to expect from Dorham in particular, but each member as well. One of the things that I love about this album is the rhythm. It reminds me of something the Jazz Messengers would have performed, but there is a strong link between Dorham and that group since he was a member. I am sure that some of his compositions were influenced by his stint with them.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples on [[ASIN:B00QURR9Z6 Trompeta Toccata (Remastered 2014)]] for a taste on what's on this album musically. What you will be hear in the snippets is the great solos by Dorham and Henderson, but there is enough to give you an idea. Most of the music has a definite Afro-Cuban feel, especially Trompeta Toccata. Actually Mamacita is more Brazilian with it's Bossa Nova feel. Toss in some blues and wrap it in hard bop and you have this album.<br /><br />All of the tracks are Dorham compositions except Mamacita, which was written by Henderson. The rhythm section is as interesting as the compositions. Tommy Flanagan's piano and Tootie Heath's drumming are very well suited to the songs - both did stints with Sonny Rollins who could play hard bop with a Latin tinge along the same lines as the tracks on this album. In fact, Flanagan was the pianist on Saxophone Colossus. I am less familiar with bassisgt Richard Davis, but his playing on this album is perfect for the compositions and arrangements.<br /><br />The album was recorded for Blue Note at Rudy van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio on September 14, 1964. It would be Dorham's last album as a leader, which is a shame because his body of work during the period leading to this album (and including it) held a lot of promise in my opinion.",[],B000GPI16O,B000GPI16O,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-14 13:06:10.000,0,False,A Healthier You
5.0,A rare find,"This is actually a double album set of Timmons' Trio sessions for Prestige. What I love is the two trios assembled for these sessions.<br /><br />The first six tracks are the album titled Little Barefoot Soul  (Prestige PR 7335). This was recorded at Rudy van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio on June 18, 1964. Here Timmons is backed by Sam Jones on bass and Ray Lucas on drums. I am very familiar with Jones' body of recorded work, but Lucas is new to me. Both, however, provide a solid rhythmic foundation for Timmons. With the exception of track 6, which is a traditional piece Timmons composed and arranged this album.<br /><br />The last six tracks are the album titled Chun-King  (Prestige PR 7351) and were recorded in the same studio on August 12, 1964. Here Timmons is backed by Keter Betts on bass and Tootie Heath on drums. While the first rhythm section is solid, I find this one to be exciting. I am very familiar with both Betts and Heath, and they certainly do not disappoint on this album. Unlike the previous album only two tracks are Timmons' compositions (tracks 8 and 10). The title track, Chun-King was composed by Betts and Charlie Byrd.<br /><br />If you are a Bobby Timmons fan I would call this an essential album.

It's as though there are two distinct parts as well, although tracks are interleaved on the album from the two sessions.<br /><br />The first three tracks have a piano lounge feel with Timmons concertizing in places. Track 4 picks up the pace at a bright tempo that is maintained on tracks 5 and 6, then he goes back to a concert feel on the last track.<br /><br />Tracks 3, 4 and 6 were recorded first on August 12, 1963 with Timmons backed by Ron Carter on bass and Connie Kay of the Modern Jazz Quartet on drums. The remaining tracks were recorded on September 10, 1963 with Timmons and Kay, but Sam Jones on bass.<br /><br />As you can see, even with different bassists and tempos, each session produced concertized and faster tempo tracks. In fact, it's so cohesive that it would be difficult to tell there were different members and dates.<br /><br />While this is not my absolute favorite Timmons album it still merits five stars in my opinion for the diverse styles and consistent playing (by both Timmons and his rhythm sections.)",[],B000000Z1U,B000000Z1U,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-14 15:23:23.000,0,False,An Intense Reading Experience
5.0,Musical beauty,"This is literally a study on arrangement for musicians. The use of two basses, a guitar and percussion to not only play melody but harmony is ingenious. Of course I am not really surprised because both NHØP and Sam Jones are masters. I am surprised by the arrangements though.<br /><br />Sound samples and a track list are on the MP3 album's page at [[ASIN:B002RA5V4G Double Bass]]. Do run through the tracks to get a tantalizing hint of the music. Normally I would advise sound samples as the main source of what an album contains, but for this one they are not sufficient to convey the music in all of its genius. However, do refer to that page for the track list as well.<br /><br />The original album was released with eight tracks - alternate takes of A Notion and Miss Morgan have been added to this release. In addition to Pedersen and Jones, Philip Catherine is on guitar. He and Pedersen had collaborated extensively prior to this album, and he also was one of Chet Baker's top picks on guitar. In my opinion he was the linchpin who made the arrangements as strong as they are on this album. That is something that the sound samples will not reveal, but the full tracks will. That is also why I claim that this album is a study in arrangement.<br /><br />In addition to Pedersen, Jones and Catherine, Billy Higgins on drums and Tootie Heath on tambourine add to the music with their rhythmic foundation. It's yet another aspect of this album to study how percussion can support bass instead of locking into that instrument. Heath is only on three tracks (A Notion, I Fall In Love Too Easily and Little Train.)<br /><br />This album was recorded for the Steeple Chase label on February 15 and 16, 1976, and released the same year.",[],B00000G62F,B00000G62F,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-14 21:56:11.000,3,False,The Awakening Experience
5.0,Harbinger of greatness,"This gem is Hawes first album as a leader. Most of of the releases of this album were plagued by hiss, but this one has it at a minimal level.

Not only do they accurately represent the sound quality, but the music nearly leaps out. Hawes and his trio are literally on fire.

Track 4 is Hawes solo.<br /><br />Three of the songs are Hawes' own compositions (tracks 3, 5 and 6), with the rest of the album devoted to standards.<br /><br />Back to the story about the hiss: this entire album was recorded for Contemporary on June 28, 1955, after hours,  at the Los Angeles Police Academy gym. According to my research the engineer was a Capitol Records employee who was moonlighting. The hiss resulted from an attempt to remaster and mellow out the sound a bit.

He is ably backed by Red Mitchell on bass and Chuck Thompson on drums, who were his first trio. Both are up to the task of supporting Hawes musically. Mitchell would become a a prolific and highly respected musician in his own right.<br /><br />The songs chosen are interesting. There is a little swing, Ellington style, bebop compositions by Bird and Monk, and standards. Both Hawes and his rhythm section contributed compositions too - Hawes penned track 3, and Mitchell and Thompson share composer credits for track 9.<br /><br />This album was recorded for Contemporary, with track 7 from the first album that was recorded on June 28, 1955 in the Los Angeles Police Academy gym, and the remaining tracks recorded in Contemporary's studios in Los Angeles on December 3, 1955 and January 25, 1956.",[],B000000YHU,B000000YHU,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-15 17:13:54.000,3,False,The Way Out of Depression - Real Advice for the Real World
5.0,Third time is a charm,"This is Hawes third album as a leader and while the first two were five star albums (in my opinion), this one tops them. Or at least is as good. I wish there were sound samples to convey the power of Hawes' playing and how tight his rhythm section is. In fact, one of the reasons why I think this tops the previous ones is he, bassist Red Mitchell and drummer Chuck Thompson had hit their stride.<br /><br />It would be difficult for me to pick a single track, but since I have run through this album twice before writing this review I would pick Body and Soul. Of course, I am fickle enough to change my mind the next time I play the album, and there is one excellent track after the other from which to choose.<br /><br />Like the previous two albums this one has an interesting set list. Tracks 2 and 10 are Hawes' own compositions, track 5 is a bebop piece (Hawes has at least one on each of the albums in this set), with a traditional tune (track 8) and the rest standards. One reason why I love the songs selected is I can listen to Hawes in a number of different contexts. He comes across as having the ability to play any genre given him, and does it with both style and authenticity.<br /><br />This album was recorded for Contemporary at their Los Angeles studios on January 25, 1956.

On the remaining three tracks he cleverly spliced two standards, September in the Rain and Tenderly, into Septemberly. Then used the same splicing technique to create All The Things You Can C#, basing that song on All the Things You Are and Prelude in C Sharp Minor. Moreover, he completely rearranged Gordon and Warren's Serenade in Blue.<br /><br />Here are the tracks:<br />A1  Jump Monk<br />A2  Serenade In Blue<br />A3  Percussion Discussion<br />B1  Work Song<br />B2  Septemberly<br />B3  All The Things You C-Sharp<br /><br />The album was recorded at the Cafe Bohemia on December 23, 1955.

5.0,The real thing,"I've owned this album for over twenty years. This is as close as you are going to get to Kansas City-style jazz in this day and age.<br /><br />Like the KC flavor, this is heavy with blues, and the entire band swings on each track. What I love is Jeannie's vocals. She can deliver and sell a song and her piano work is also exceptional. Of course husband Jimmy is as exceptional, especially the sound his bass trombone brings to the mix. Both teamed to arrange this album, which is one reason why it evokes KC of days past.<br /><br />As authentically as this album captures the Kansas City sound, neither Jeannie nor Jimmy are from there. In fact, in addition to being musicians they were both educators.<br /><br />The other musicians on this album also make a significant contribution to the sound. In addition to Jimmy on bass trombone the front line here is Nolan Andrew Smith and Snooky Young on trumpet, accompanied by a reed and woodwind section comprised of Ricky Woodard on clarinet, and soprano and tenor saxophones, Dinky Morris on soprano and baritone saxophones, Charles Owens on alto and baritone saxophones, and Hank Crawford on alto sax.

5.0,Red hot,"This album truly showcases the Cheatham's talents as arrangers and musicians. Like all of their albums this one has a Kansas City vibe with a touch of New Orleans thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Going through the track list (as I listen to the album) I cannot pick just one favorite. I definitely Love Blues Like Jay McShann and Buddy Bolden's Blues, one for the tribute to Kansas City great, and the other for the tribute to Bolden who arguably is the inventor of jazz. And both have a vintage vibe and sound.<br /><br />The real treat, though, is Jeannie's vocals and piano. On this album she is more of the former, but is a virtuoso with both. Husband Jimmy is a master of bass trombone. Another thing that I love is there is enough brass to round out the ensemble, but their signature sound comes from reeds and woodwinds. With Jimmy's trombone providing bottom, the front line also includes Nolan Smith and Snooky Young on trumpet and flugelhorn, and Curtis Peagler on alto sax, Rickey Woodard on alto sax and clarinet, Frank Wess on tenor sax and flute, and Dinky Morris on baritone sax. The rhythm section is comprised of Jeannie on piano, Red Callender on bass and John Harris on drums.<br /><br />This album was recorded in Los Angeles in early November 1991, and released the next year.

5.0,A study in arranging,"This is a masterpiece in arranging - it takes genius to rearrange a large ensemble's seminal work into a still recognizable work performed by a piano trio. If you compare the original [[ASIN:B00FZ0UH2G West Side Story (1961 Film Soundtrack) ]] to this album you will appreciate the arrangements and performance by the trio. More importantly, he manages distill down the original score into seven songs and perform them in a way that is true to the original score.<br /><br />While Peterson handles the melody lines (ably assisted by Ray Brown on bass in places), it's Brown and drummer Ed Thigpen who shoulder a large role for pulling off the rearrangement from large ensemble to trio. The entire West Side Story suite required a strong and complex rhythmic foundation and the way Brown and Thigpen interpreted and provided it in this trio setting is nothing short of remarkable in my opinion. As a drummer I have dissected this album musically many times and remain in awe of it.<br /><br />This album certainly epitomizes Peterson's  genius (as well as the musicianship of  Brown and Thigpen), and to my ears this album stands the test of time. It is as fresh and relevant today as it was over a half century ago when it was first recorded for Verve in NYC during two sessions spanning January 24 and 25, 1962.",[],B00JPMJ456,B00JPMJ456,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-21 07:51:20.000,0,False,Basic Cooking Techniques
5.0,More KC style music with Clarence 'Gatemouth' Brown on three tracks,"I have been a staunch fan of the Cheathams for over two decades, and this is among my favorite albums. First, it has that Kansas City vibe as do the rest of their albums from this period. Second, there is a little New Orleans in the mix, and, third, Clarence 'Gatemouth' Brown is a guest on it.<br /><br />There is a little of everything musically, including an old Blue Lu and Danny Barker tune from 1938 (track 6) to a Muddy Waters piece (track 9). One of my favorite tracks is Trav'lin' Light. The main reason is Jeannie Cheatham makes no attempt to make it sound like Billie Holiday's iconic rendition, but also because the arrangement is so unique that it rivals Lady Day's version in some ways. Of course there are some Cheatham compositions on the album as well.<br /><br />The line-up on this album is nothing short of spectacular. Of particular note this is one of the last recordings Jimmy Noone Jr. made. He and his father before him were New Orleans icons - his father was one of the first jazz musicians at the turn of the last century.<br /><br />Here is the line-up: front line has Jimmy Cheatham on bass trombone (which is one of the reasons why this album has such a distinctive sound.) He is accompanied by Nolan Smith and Eugene Young on trumpet and fluglehorn, and a strong reed and woodwind section comprised of Noone on clarinet, soprano sax and tenor sax, Curtis Peagler on alto and tenor sax, and Dinky Morris on tenor and baritone sax. The rhythm section is led by Jeannie who also does the vocals, Red Callender on bass and John Harris on drums. Clarence Gatemouth  Brown is on guitar on tracks 1, 3 and 4.<br /><br />This album was recorded at Sage and Sound studios in Los Angeles in May 1990.",[],B0000006IX,B0000006IX,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-21 16:03:34.000,0,False,The Psychology of Minimalism
5.0,An abundance of riches,"I am just now discovering this album. I have the later one with the Hamilton/Horn/Smith/Katz/Hall/Collette line-up and, honestly, am torn about which I like more. Both have much to love, starting with the song selection and musicians.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples on this page to hear just how nicely each Ellington tune is arranged and performed. The thing I most love about this, though, is how Hamilton and ensemble pull off Ellington without a piano. Credit, in a large part, go to Hamilton's arrangements as well as John Pisano's guitar.<br /><br />A contrast between this one and the later one released as World Pacific WP-1258 is the line-up itself. This one is sparse in comparison. While Eric Dolphy is excellent on alto sax, bass clarinet and flute on this album, he is switching among them while the other album has Paul Horn switching between alto sax and flute, augmented by Buddy Collette switching between alto and tenor sax. That ensemble had a richer, fuller sound  because of it. However, as a musician I truly admire the way this album is pulled off as a quintet.<br /><br />On the topic of contrast, if you have this and the later album, the song selections are almost the same. This allows you to hear the differences - and there are some major differences in feel and performance - between the two arrangements and performances. Plus, you can easily contrast between Nathan Gershman's cello here against Fred Katz on the other album, and  bassists Hal Gaylor here against Carson Smith on the other one. Of course drawing a contrast between John Pisano and Jim Hall on guitar is also a reason to own both albums if you play that instrument or are a musician interested in various approaches to arranging.<br /><br />This album was recorded for the Pacific Jazz label in Los Angeles in a single session on August 22, 1958 and languished in the vault until 2000. If you own the World Pacific album you will love this one too. They are that different (and delightful).",[],B00004UB9B,B00004UB9B,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-21 17:24:55.000,1,False,Exotic Floral Art
5.0,West Coast delight,"This album, to me, epitomizes Edwards' playing because of both his tone and his incredible chops. In particular, his virtuoso chops are evident on every track.<br /><br />Another reason why I love this album is the supporting personnel. Joe Castro is an exceptional pianist, although sadly less known than he should be, and bassist Leroy Vinnegar has long been a favorite of mine. As a drummer I am well familiar with Billy Higgins, so his inclusion in the quartet is icing on the proverbial cake.<br /><br />The album itself is mainly up tempo and brisk. Edwards is not shy about using this as a showcase of his own talents and takes ample solos. He also allows the rhythm section to stretch, so this is not some perfunctory recording session to meet commitments - the entire quartet is obviously having fun.<br /><br />Three of the tracks (1, 4 and 7) are Edwards' own compositions. The remaining tracks span a wider range of music with a little Ellington (Strayhorn) swing, Bird's bebop and standards. There is even a Hampton Hawes composition (track 6).<br /><br />This was recorded for the Contemporary label in their Los Angeles studio on August 17, 1960. If you are an Edwards fan this album is worth it.",[],B000000YY2,B000000YY2,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-22 10:25:30.000,2,False,Mug Meals in Minutes
5.0,"A gem, but the sound quality is a little raw","Although I would normally subtract a star for sound when it is as raw as it is on this album, the authenticity of the performances won me over. In fact, the very title seems to be well matched to the sound quality and I wonder if it wasn't purposely recorded that way to give a juke joint vibe to the album.<br /><br />What truly makes this a gem is the sparseness of the arrangements - wife Billie on piano and vocals, husband De De on cornet, and drummer Albert Jiles playing drums that is like a time capsule. No modern drum kit playing. You are hearing old school trap set playing from the classical (Dixieland) jazz era.<br /><br />The tracks range from New Orleans standards that date back to the earliest years of jazz, to traditional and even some of their own compositions. The feel is a nice combination of traditional jazz/ragtime, heavily infused with the blues. The bonus tracks are all from a compilation titled New Orleans: The Living Legends released by Riverside.<br /><br />This album was recorded for the Riverside label in New Orleans on January 27, 1961. The original album without the bonus tracks clocked in at a little over 39 minutes. This one is 52 minutes long.",[],B000000Z9L,B000000Z9L,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-22 10:55:04.000,0,False,Compelling Reading
5.0,"Not audiophile sound quality, but like a time capsule","Normally I would subtract a star (or more) for modern recordings with marginal sound quality. The albums in this set all have natural reverb as though they were recorded in an acoustically live room instead of a recording studio. Perhaps they were all live, but at any rate do not expect balanced sound.<br /><br />What you can expect is a collection of albums that are like time capsules. In fact two albums are led by musicians who were born with jazz in the 1890s, and the other two are led my musicians who were born in the early 1900s, so the tracks in this set are about as authentic as you can get. More importantly, while the sound is not as good as I would like, it's superior to the early recordings on wax cylinders and shellac LPs on which most of the songs were originally recorded by the original artists.<br /><br />All of the albums were recorded for Riverside in New Orleans in January 1961. There is no indication where in New Orleans (it could have been a budget studio or in a studio setting in a hall or club.)<br /><br />Here is what the set contains:<br />DISC ONE<br />Tracks 1 through 8 are the album titled Percy Humphrey's Crescent City Joy Makers and was recorded on January 24, 1961. Humphrey is on trumpet accompanied by Louis Nelson on trombone and Albert Burbank on clarinet. The rhythm section is Emanuel Sayles on banjo and guitar, Louis James on bass and Josiah Frazier on drums.<br />1. Milenberg Joys<br />2. Over in Gloryland<br />3. Lonesome Road<br />4. We Shall Walk Through the Streets of the City<br />5. Weary Blues<br />6. Bucket's Got a Hole in It<br />7. All the Gals Like the Way I Ride<br />8. Rip `Em up Joe<br /><br />Tracks 9 through 16 are the album titled Sweet Emma  The Bell Gal  and Her Dixieland Boys Featuring Jim Robinson that was recorded on January 25, 1961. Emma Barrett is on piano and vocals, accompanied by Percy Humphrey on trumpet, Jim Robinson on trombone and Willie Humphrey on Clarinet. They are backed by Emanuel Sayles on banjo and guitar, McNeal Breaux on bass and Josiah Frazier on drums.<br />9. Bill Bailey<br />10. Chinatown<br />11. Down in Honky Tonk Town<br />12. The Bell Gal's Careless Blues<br />13. I Ain't Gonna Give Nobody None of This Jelly Roll<br />14. Just a Little While to Stay Here<br />15. Tishomingo Blues<br />16. When the Saints Go Marching In<br /><br />DISC TWO<br />Tracks 1 through 9 are the album titled Jim Robinson's New Orleans Band, which was recorded on January 24 and 30, 1961. The line-up features Jim Robinson on trombone, Ernest Cagnolati on trumpet and Louis Cottrell Jr. on clarinet (Cottrell's father was one one of the drummers from the first generation of jazz musicians and who invented keeping time with a press roll!) The rhythm section includes Creole George Guesnon on banjo, Alcide Pavageau on bass and Alfred Williams on drums.<br />1. Ice Cream<br />2. In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree<br />3. Mobile Stomp<br />4. Bogalusa Strut<br />5. Jada<br />6. Bugle Boy March<br />7. Yearning<br />8. Whenever You're Lonely<br />9. When You Wore a Tulip<br /><br />Tracks 10 through 18 are the album Vocal Blues and Cornet in the Classic Tradition that was recorded on January 27, 1961. This is a simple ensemble comprised of Billie Pierce on piano and vocals, DeDe Pierce on cornet and Albert Jiles on drums. On the last track it's just Billie and Jiles.<br />10.

5.0,A reissue plus three bonus tracks,"The first twelve tracks are from an album originally titled New Orleans Music that was recorded at Preservation Hall in 1959. I could not find the exact date. The remaining three tracks are from an session for the Tone label (again, that is all I could find.)<br /><br />Sound is somewhat spotty, but the performances and even the less than stellar sound quality will transport you to a juke joint. It's that authentic. In fact, run through the sound samples on this page for a taste of the music.<br /><br />Arrangements are as authentic as the playing and vocals. The first twelve tracks feature Billie Pierce on vocals and piano and De De Pierce on some vocals and cornet. They are joined by percussion on most of the tracks (the washboard on tracks 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 12 is credited to Brother Randolph and the tom tom on track 7 is credited to Lucius Bridges who also provides vocals on track 12.) The last three tracks are Billie solo on vocals and piano.<br /><br />Combining the sound samples and the sparse arrangements it's easy to fell as though you are eavesdropping on a bygone era.

5.0,A treasure,"I do not know why it took me so long to discover this album since I have all of Hunter's other work from this period (including two videos). If you are familiar with her body of work after her 'rediscovery' then you already know what to expect.<br /><br />What I love is some of the musicians are part of Hunter's comeback (Gerald Cook on piano and Al Hall on bass), and others like Doc Cheatam on trumpet are from an era when she was active before taking a career left turn and then languishing in retirement. In fact, Cheatam is only ten years her junior and actually played for Bessie Smith (who made Hunter's Downhearted Blues famous).<br /><br />The music is actually more authentic than one realizes - a time capsule of sorts - with arrangements that could have come from Hunter's earlier career. For me the choice of musicians are perfect. Vic Dickenson on trombone is only a year younger than Cheatam and Budd Johnson on tenor sax is not far behind as only four years junior to Dickenson. Those three, along with Hunter, reach back to an era that gives this album a great deal of authenticity. Adding in Wally Richardson on guitar and drummer Connie Kay whose approach is tasteful and musical in its own right and you have all of the ingredients for great blues. Kay, by the way, was replaced by drummer Jackie Williams on the last two tracks.<br /><br />Overall, this is ranks with [[ASIN:B00138F79W Amtrak Blues]] in my opinion as shining examples of Hunter's later recordings.",[],B00AQA94PG,B00AQA94PG,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-26 17:40:05.000,1,False,Poems for the Hopeless Romantic
5.0,A delightful blend of earlier urban blues styles,"This album was conceived as a showcase for Charles Brown's style of blues and manages to stay close to that genre. Brown's style is similar to earlier Nat King Cole Trio's style - smooth, sophisticated, but still blues.<br /><br />The best way to gauge the album is to run through the sound samples on this page. Not every track fits the urban blues paradigm in the strictest sense, but the overall theme is in the ballpark.<br /><br />Muldaur's vocals are the real grabber. I own nearly all of her albums and would consider myself a staunch fan. She has always managed to pull off any style from folk to bluegrass to blues and jazz ... and a lot in between. This is, to me, one of her smoothest and most sensuous albums in my collection. Perhaps some of her earlier work is technically better from a vocal perspective, but her voice here is like a fine, aged wine with nuances and complexities in her delivery that are perfect for the tracks chosen.<br /><br />Unfortunately Brown passed away before this album could be completed, but he does appear on track three in a duet with Muldaur. Stories vary about the particulars. Some accounts claim he actually came into the studio and others that the recording was made at his bedside. Regardless, the track is the centerpiece of this album for me, and the arrangements of most of the tracks show Brown's influence.<br /><br />Here is the complete rundown on the musicians who back Muldaur on this album:<br />Core ensemble: Steve Campos on trumpet, cornet and flugelhorn, Kevin Porter on trombone, bass trombone and tuba, Jim Rothermel on tenor and alto sax, and clarinet, Reggie McBride on bass and Tony Braunagel on drums.<br /><br />Most of the piano and organ on the album are played by David Mathews (tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12), with Chris Burns on ongan on track 12 and piano on tracks 5 and 7, and Marty Grebb on piano on track 8. Guitars are Danny Caron on tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 12, Cranston Clements on tracks 7, 8 and 10, and Anthony Paule on tracks 7 and 8.

5.0,Lomax's collected tracks plus bonus ones,"PH-50-NC's March 12, 2007 review is on the mark. The Lomax tracks comprise the first 21 in this album, while the remaining ones are more contemporary. I am going to focus on the Alan Lomax tracks because they are why I purchased this album. If you are not familiar with him, he followed in his father John's footsteps as a folklorist and both were largely responsible for collecting folk music (including blues and other styles) via field recordings.<br /><br />These recordings were made between 1954 and 1955 as a conscious effort to record music in rural or rustic areas that were as pristine as possible regarding tradition. The track titles on this page indicate where the track was recorded; i.e., track 4 would be a Calabrese song from Reggio di Calabria.<br /><br />This album was originally released in 1958 by the Tradition Records label and contained twenty-two tracks. I have no idea why one of the tracks was dropped for this album, but it does not detract from the overall value of the album if you want to hear Italian folk songs in their more traditional form. I seriously doubt anything remotely resembling these renditions exist anywhere in Italy today.<br /><br />Note that a lot of the music on the first twenty-one tracks are from the south. Not all, but enough to show where Lomax's interests were focused.<br /><br />The best way to get a sense of the music and quality of the recordings (which by their nature are relatively crude), give the sound samples on this page a listen. You will notice a dramatic difference on the part of the album that starts with track 22. Consider those to be a bonus, and for me they are a delight.<br /><br />Bottom line: this album is more for those of us who want to step into the past and hear folk music from Italy. In my case, since my family is from Calabria and emigrated in the late 1890s, some of the tracks are like a link to a past I never knew or understood.",[],B000002NQM,B000002NQM,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-27 07:28:29.000,1,False,Essential Information
5.0,Rekindled my interest in Clooney and brings back personal memories,"This album is special to me, but I will not bore you with that part until the end of the review. What I love is how this had rekindled my interest in Clooney's body of work, and refocused my attention to her talent. Of course, Midler is no slouch when it comes to interpreting the songs either.<br /><br />A lot of credit goes to Barry Manilow as well. His arrangements (with Midler's own involvement) are another reason why I love this album. Finally, the backing musicians are simply first rate as well.<br /><br />Instead of my trying to describe the music, listen to the sound samples on this page. They will convey what is familiar and what is unique about each track and its arrangement. We all have favorites, and mine would be the one song Clooney hated: Mambo Italiano. It's an ear worm to be sure,  but more than any song it evokes memories of Ms. Clooney since that is one that I mainly associate with her.<br /><br />Another favorite is A Slow Boat to China, and that is why this album is so special. The story is my dearly departed loved that song, so we would often play this entire album. She would have been 63 on the first of November, so in some ways writing this is a way to bring back memories of a better time.<br /><br />However, I do not want to come across as maudlin. This album has a lot of up tempo material, and between the arrangements and Midler's ability to interpret and deliver a song is yet another reason why I love it.<br /><br />This time of the year it gets a lot of play time, but even without the personal connection if you are a Rosemary Clooney (or Bette Midler) fan, this album will delight you. It's the perfect tribute to Clooney and a testimony to Midler's (and Manilow's) talents.",[],B003IMV8J4,B003IMV8J4,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-27 18:59:27.000,0,False,Be Present in the Now
5.0,A turning point album for me,"I first heard this album while stationed and living in Hawaii in 1973. It was a turning point in my musical journey because of In the Mood in particular. That revealed to me that the stuff my parents listened to when I was growing up was not as corny as I once believed. Also, the Wardell Gray/Annie Ross piece, Twisted, caught my attention, and from these I started paying more attention to big band/swing, as well as the 'hip' music from the 50s that I somehow missed.<br /><br />Actually, the entire album is an eclectic collection of tracks from different genres. The arrangements gave each track a period-correct feel, and Midler's ability to deliver a song with white hot energy made me an instant fan.<br /><br />Give the sound samples a quick listen. Every track is a masterpiece, and there are more than a few standards tossed in to make it all the more interesting. The sequence sort of keeps you off balance too - imagine seguing from Glenn Miller's anthem, In the Mood, to a girl group medley of Uptown/Don't Say Nothin' Bad About My Baby/Da Doo Ron Ron.<br /><br />This is early Midler at her finest. I am listening to it as I write and it still sounds viable and relatively fresh today. Perhaps the arrangements could be modernized, but it still swings, gets your feet tapping and catches you by surprise.",[],B0017CW5DA,B0017CW5DA,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-27 19:17:03.000,10,True,Treasures for Spiritual Growth
5.0,Ground zero for Bette,"Back in 1973 I purchased this and [[ASIN:B0017CW5DA Bette Midler]] (on LP) and practically wore them out. Midler's approach to music - especially in song selection - was a turning point in my own musical tastes back then. I was not interested in the direction that rock was taking, and this album in particular had songs that were very familiar to me - especially the girl group songs on this album.<br /><br />If I had to describe the album in a word it would be 'smorgasbord', but one offering familiar instead of exotic. Back in the day I preferred the aforementioned Bette Midler album, but today this one is still getting a lot of play.<br /><br />In the absence of sound samples describing the music is difficult. The arrangements on this one are not totally seamless or consistent from one track to the next, and the song sequence makes this seem more like a sampler than a coherent album. I am guessing that since this was Midler's inaugural album the producers were experimenting. That apparently paid off because tracks 1, 6 and 10 made the Top 40 as singles. I especially like her delivery of track 1 (Do You Want to Dance). That arrangement seems to be inspired by the slower tempo, 1966 rendition by the Mamas and Papas, which is a nice contrast to the brighter tempos of the song as performed by Cliff Richards and the Shadows, the Beatles and The Beach Boys.<br /><br />Most of the 'girl group' songs are fairly close to the originals, but the track that grabbed my attention back in 1973 was Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy. It is close to the Andrews Sisters rendition, but literally exploded with energy when I hear it on this album. Immediately that song went from corny stuff my parents used to listen to, to cool and hip - and it sparked my interest in music from my parents' era.<br /><br />That I am still listening to this album, albeit not in the original LP format, over forty years later is testimony to its timeless quality.",[],B000002J5H,B000002J5H,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-10-29 12:35:30.000,7,True,Delicious Comfort Foods
5.0,From a marathon session,"This album is actually led by Sonny Stitt, but is one of two albums that Oscar Peterson and his trio recorded in a single session. The other one is [[ASIN:B003UAW9EW A Jazz Portrait Of Frank Sinatra]] that features the Trio alone.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples for a taste of the music. Stitt is his usual busy self, and switches between alto and tenor saxophones. Some of the music has a frenetic quality, and also drifts into hard bop territory, but strangely the marrying of Stitt with Oscar Peterson comes off perfectly.<br /><br />The trio is the classic one featuring Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums. For me Thigpen's playing is a surprise. He has long been my inspiration for brushwork and lighter, more tasteful playing, but here he lets loose. Suffice to say he has the chops to play anything he wants and this album is proof of that.<br /><br />This album was recorded in Paris, France for Verve on May 18, 1959, and would not be the only marathon session that year. Two months later the Trio would be in the Universal Recording Studios in Chicago spanning July 14 through August 9, 1959 and knock out ten albums.",[],B001G9LVLG,B001G9LVLG,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-11-07 14:12:24.000,2,False,Time Management

5.0,Beautiful tribute,"This is one of my thrift store finds. I already had it on disc, but could not pass it up. It was recorded in a single session for Norman Grantz' Pablo label in Los Angeles on June 21, 1974. Since there is no track list I am providing it and track times so you know what you are getting:<br />A1 Satin Doll 5:46<br />A2 I Let A Song Go Out Of My Heart 5:32<br />A3 Sophisticated Lady 3:40<br />A4 I Got It Bad 3:41<br />A5 In A Mellowtone 6:20<br />B1 Solitude 5:06<br />B2 Don't Get Around Much Anymore 6:31<br />B3 Do Nothin' 'Till You Hear From Me 5:53<br />B4 Caravan 6:10<br /><br />It clocks in at a short 48:39, but is so intense that it seems longer. for me Pass is at his best on this album. Words cannot describe how beautifully Pass handles Ellington's compositions and signature tunes. Granted, credit also goes to Ray Brown on bass and Bobby Durham on drums, but it's Pass and his guitar that make this album special.<br /><br />One of the reasons why I give Pass so much credit is Ellington's tunes were always personal as well as complicated. He wrote and arranged for specific musicians instead of instruments, and that makes Pass' interpretation all the more impressive. It's one thing to have absolute command of an instrument, and quite another to have a deep understanding of music and the composer's and arranger's thoughts when interpreting and performing.

5.0,Five stars for Perkins on piano and historical value,"One of the reasons to purchase this album - aside from being a Chet Baker and/or Art Pepper fan - is this album represents the only tracks they recorded together. The other is Carl Perkins on piano who did not leave behind a large legacy of recorded work. If you are new to jazz, he is NOT the rockabilly guitarist, but one of the finest pianists of the era.<br /><br />The music is hard bop with a distinct West Coast flavor. Although the tracks sound like a jam session at Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse this is a studio album that was recorded at the Radio Recorders studio in Los Angeles on October 31, 1956. Baker and Pepper are accompanied by Phil Urso on tenor sax and backed by Carl Perkins on piano, Curtis Counce on bass and Lawrence Marable on drums.<br /><br />Normally I prefer Chet accompanied by a baritone sax because that instrument is a perfect complement to his penchant for playing in lower registers. However, there is something compelling about Chet and Art Pepper's alto sax. To be honest I cannot put my finger on it. Perhaps it's not just a lower register instrument, but an Eb one that seems to go with Baker's trumpet.<br /><br />There is nothing Earth-shattering about the actual music other than it is rock solid and has moments of genius. Those moments are followed by levels of performance that you would expect from such an ensemble of luminaries, but nothing seminal. That said, this is still a nice listen and had it not been for the Baker-Pepper pairing and Perkins in the mix I would probably have rated it four stars.",[],B00UN7F9SI,B00UN7F9SI,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-11-16 16:11:44.000,2,False,Nurture Your Creativity
5.0,A different side of Peterson,"Aside from the title, this is one of my favorite Peterson albums because it showcases his versatility. The title would even be apt if it weren't for the fact that this is more of a tribute to Brazilian composers, and whose mother tongues were Portuguese.  That aside, the music is universal.<br /><br />If you run through the sound samples on this page you can get a flavor of the album as well as Peterson's incredible playing. This is also a percussionist's delight because most of the backing ensemble are on percussion. The only two exceptions are Peterson (although a piano is a percussion instrument in a manner of speaking) and Sam Jones on bass.<br /><br />Two of the tracks are Peterson's own compositions - tracks 6 and 9 - and there is a pop tune also included (track 2, composed by Tony Hatch and made famous by Petula Clark). Finally the first track actually has a Spanish title, although like the remainder of the tracks were penned by Brazilian composers.<br /><br />The backing ensemble on percussion is comprised of Harold Jones who is one of my personal inspirations on general percussion, Louis Hayes on drum kit, Henley Gibson on congas and Marshall Thompson on timbales. I am guessing that Hayes and Jones on bass were on loan from Cannonball Adderley's band.<br /><br />This album was recorded at for the Limelight label at Universal Recording in Chicago on December 12 through 14, 1966. It is definitely a theme album that shows Peterson's ability to not only play just about any genre he chose, but to also compose songs in those genres.",[],B00006316G,B00006316G,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-11-22 16:17:01.000,0,False,A Motivational Book on How to Create Yourself
5.0,Grimes late in his career - and cooking!,"This is a nice collection of Grimes in various ensembles circa 1968, 1970 and 1974. Most of the tracks are from a May 13th, 1974 session that was recorded at the Decca studio in Paris. Those tracks are 1 through 5. I was unable to get specific dates for the rest of the tracks, only being able to associate them with 1968 and 1970 sessions in France.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples. Those convey a level of energy and fun that seems to be on every Grimes recording, Since there are three sessions covered spanning six years there is a subtle variety in the tracks, but that is also because of the different ensemble configurations. The entire album has a jump blues/early R&B feel that makes for toe-tapping listening.<br /><br />The first five tracks feature Grimes with Lloyd Glenn on piano, Roland Lobligeois on bass and Panama Francis on drums. Tracks 6 through 8 feature Grime with Jackie Samson on bass and Wallace Bishop on drums, Milt Buckner on track 6, and Johnny Letman on trumpet on tracks 7 and 8 (with vocals on 8). The remaining tracks feature Grimes, Georges Kelly on tenor sax, Jay McShann on piano, Francois Biensan on Hammond B3, Hayes Alvis on bass and Paul Gunther on drums.",[],B0000280LO,B0000280LO,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-12-03 15:56:50.000,2,False,A Former Reviewer Speaks About Pertinent Amazon Issues
5.0,Reunion of sorts and every bit as good as their first album,"This is the second and last album that brought together Scott Hamilton on tenor sax, Dave McKenna on piano and Jake Hanna on drums. If you are a Scott Hamilton fan you are probably wondering why there is no bassist. If you are a McKenna fan you know why.<br /><br />Sadly there are no sound samples at the time I am writing this because describing the music in words is no substitute for a snippet of each track. However, if you search the web there are entire tracks that can be heard and marveled at - and I am not exaggerating.<br /><br />Hamilton's tone, McKenna's superhuman command of his instrument and Hanna's drumming belie the fact that this is only the second time that they recorded together. In fact, McKenna is renown for preferring to play solo gigs and albums, so having him in an ensemble is one major reason to grab this album too.<br /><br />For the record the first album, recorded seven years earlier, is [[ASIN:B00KY9VVZU No Bass Hit]]. Frankly, if you get this one you may as well get that one too because these albums are relatively short and leave you wanting more.<br /><br />This one was recorded for Concord at Continental Recording in Boston in May 1986.

5.0,"Relaxing on the surface, but there is a lot of depth in the music","This is one of my favorite jazz piano albums for when I want to relax or simply chill. Larkins' playing is delicate, melodic and shares some of the same qualities that Bill Evans also brought to the instrument. Run through the sound samples for a taste of the music and sound quality. Interestingly, half of the tracks are Larkins' own compositions (2, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11).<br /><br />His backing ensemble is perfectly matched to the arrangements and song selections. Skeeter Best on guitar has the same lyrical touch as Larkins, while Joe Benjamin's bass is a little more aggressive and balances the music. Jim Crawford on drums is also a perfect choice for this album because he bridges Larkins and Best to Benjamin, somehow complementing the delicacy of piano and guitar, and keeping the pulse with Benjamin.<br /><br />Not only is the music simply beautiful, the way the songs are arranged and performed are a study in rhythm sections. I've probably learned more about jazz drumming from listening to this album than any other source that I can remember. Of course, this is not strictly for musicians - all you need is a love of jazz piano and good music to enjoy it. This album was recorded for the Decca label in NYC in 1958.

5.0,A duo and a full combo recorded eleven years apart. Two tracks feature Ben Webster on piano,"This album is more of a patchwork since tracks 4 through 7 were recorded eleven years before the rest of the album. For those tracks it's just Hinton on bass and Webster on tenor sax (except for tracks 5 and 6 on which Webster proves to be a competent stride pianist)<br /><br />The remaining tracks feature Jon Faddis in trumpet accompanied by Frank Wess and Budd Johnson on saxophone, with John Bunch on piano, Hinton on bass and Papa Jo Jones on drums. Both Wess and Johnson are on tenor sax, although Johnson switches to baritone sax on tracks 2 and 9.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples to get a taste of the music. It's definitely straight ahead and with a lot of Kansas City infused into the music. This is more like a small combo jam session than a coherently produced album, but for me that is why I rated it so highly.<br /><br />Tracks 4 through 7 were recorded in 1964  and the remainder in 1975.",[],B00005N6Q8,B00005N6Q8,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-12-20 15:49:57.000,1,False,"Cute, Colorful and Creative - A book about new experiences!"
5.0,Possibly my favorite Adderley Brothers album,"This is probably my favorite album by the Adderley brothers, and that's saying a lot because their original 1955 recordings for Savoy also get a lot of playtime when I am driving (or relaxing at home). And five years between those albums and this one show a dramatic maturing in their music. Part of that is because of the members of this ensemble, especially the two pianists who are featured, but a part is they hit their stride.<br /><br />The sound samples on this page will convey all you need to know about the music. This album also is one more mark in the way jazz was evolving around 1960. The four watershed albums by Miles Davis, Brubeck, Ornette Coleman, and Mingus from the year before had started a transformation, but this one was headed in a slightly different direction. I believe in large part because of musicians such as Bobby Timmons who exhibits his usual playfulness and soul bent on tracks 5 through 7 and 9. In fact, Tracks 5 and 9 are Timmons' own compositions. Plus Nat Adderley's Work Song was unveiled on this album.<br /><br />This was recorded in two sessions for Riverside. The core ensemble is Nat on cornet and Cannonball on alto sax, with Sam Jones on bass and Louis Hayes on drums. Jones, by the way, is the composer of track 6 - a song I first heard when Carmen McRae performed it in the early 1960s. The other pianist is Barry Harris who brings an entirely different feel in the rhythm section on tracks 1 through 4 and 8. He infuses bebop and hard bop, contrasting with Timmons' soul and gospel. A great contrast that keeps this album fresh to my ears no matter how many times I play it.<br /><br />The session featuring Timmons on piano was recorded at the Reeves Sound Studios in NYC on February 1, 1960. The one featuring Harris on piano was recorded at the Ter-Mar Recording Studio in Chicago on March 29, 1960.",[],B00004T2RG,B00004T2RG,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-12-25 19:47:14.000,2,False,"2 Weeks of Trying New Recipes – Lasagna Soup, Slow Cooker Butter Chicken and a Giant Cinnamon Roll"
5.0,Outstanding Blue Note issue that rivals any 'studio jam' that Verve issued,"Excellent sound quality and high energy playing. Not all tracks are fast tempo, but all have each musician giving their all, and that is one of the reasons why I rated this so highly.<br /><br />Since there are sound samples on this page I will not attempt to describe the music because I'll fall short. The samples will convey the essence of this album. What I especially love - aside from the music - is the balanced sound where each musician is where they should be in the mix. I am sure that it's partly due to RVG's skill, but I am sure that the site - Manhattan Towers in NYC - and the room had something to do with it as well.<br /><br />Three of the songs are Burrell's own compositions (Disc 1,tracks 1 and 2, and Disc 2, track 3. Duke Jordan contributed a song (Disc 1, track 3), as did Sam Jones (Disc 2, track 3).Also note that Disc 1,track 5 was not on the original release, although it was part of the original recording session.<br /><br />All of the tracks were recorded on May 14, 1958 with a core ensemble comprised of Burrell on guitar, Louis Smith on trumpet, Tina Brooks and Junior Cook on tenor sax, Sam Jones on bass and Art Blakey in drums. The rhythm section on Disc 1 is led by Duke Jordan and Bobby Timmons on Disc 2 - both are excellent pianists, and each has a different style that seems to fit the songs on which they were featured.<br /><br />As for Brooks and Cook, they shared tracks 3 and 5 on Disc 1 and 1 through 3 on Disc 2. Cook is the sole tenor on Disc 1, track 1, while Brooks is on track 2 of the same disc.",[],B000005H9Q,B000005H9Q,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-12-26 19:22:10.000,2,False,Cute Caterpillar Themed Board Book
5.0,The title album plus a significant amount of the album titled This Is Tal Farlow,"Farlow is simply amazing on all of the tracks on this album and a half. Sadly there are no sound samples at the time of this review because his playing in both trio (the first eight tracks) and quartet on the remaining ones shows just how powerful and musical he was during this period.<br /><br />The first eight tracks are the title album, and were recorded in NYC for Norman Granz' Norgran label in 1956.The album would be reissued on Verve. It features Eddie Costa on piano and Vinnie Burke on bass, both of whom are excellent on the album. Costa achieved wider fame - to a degree - but Burke did not get the recognition he deserved. Here is an opportunity to hear just how tight the three are as a trio, as well as Farlow's earlier work that is actually jaw dropping.<br /><br />All of the remaining tracks were recorded for Verve in NYC on January 17 and 18, and March 3, 1958 for an album titled This Is Tal Farlow. It is almost the complete album, so it's a nice bonus. These tracks feature Farlow and Costa backed by Bill Tackus with Knobby Totah on some tracks on bass, and Jimmy Campbell on drums.<br /><br />If you are a Farlow (or Costa) fan this is a treasure, and all of the tracks contain some of the best jazz guitar (and piano) from the era.",[],B004785JFC,B004785JFC,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2015-12-29 14:25:46.000,5,False,Great Christmas Present
5.0,Two complete albums from a 1967 London session,"This album contains all but three tracks that were recorded in a single recording session for the Black Lion label in London on June 18, 1967. These tracks would ultimately be issued as two separate albums crediting Wilson as leader, along with one track included in a compilation of various jazz artists signed to the same label.<br /><br />The music is typical Wilson. His silvery touch is present on each track, but the nice surprise is while the quartet tracks are reminiscent of Benny Goodman's trios and quartets, these have Wilson's sound. It's sad that there are no sound samples (as I write this), but if you are familiar with Wilson's work this album is not disappoint.<br /><br />The line-up accompanying and backing Wilson are Dave Shepherd on clarinet and Ronnie Gleaves on vibraphone, and a rhythm section comprised of Peter Chapman on bass and Johnny Richardson on drums. Not only were the arrangements different from anything Wilson played with Goodman's small groups, but Shepherd and Gleaves made no attempt to sound like Goodman and Lionel Hampton respectively. Bravo for that!<br /><br />I mentioned that the session produced two albums, plus a track for a compilation. The two Wilson led albums are Stompin' at the Savoy (BLP 30114) and Moonglow (BLP 30133). Track 14 from this album - Avalon - was included on the album titled The Best Of Jazz - Jazz Showcase (BLP 20130).",[],B00004VMA1,B00004VMA1,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-01-01 16:57:23.000,0,False,A Well-Researched Book that Brings Perspective to Historical and Future Events
5.0,A very different Red Garland and Philly Joe Jones - worth it in my opinion,"Granted this is atypical for both Garland and Philly Joe Jones, but to my ears refreshing too. It shows a different, more nuanced side of their playing that was not evident during their Prestige years. And Carter is always interesting to me. He just seemed to keep growing and evolving throughout his career, but with a modern edge (similar to Miles Davis).<br /><br />Sadly there are no sound samples to get the gist of this album, and I will admit that if you are a staunch fan of Garland's (or Philly Joe's) earlier work this album may take a while to grow on you. It did for me, but once I finally settled in it became one that is in fairly frequent rotation, and especially when I am in the mood for mellowness. That's not to say that the entire album is laidback - there are spikes of energy - but the entire approach is ... well, atypical, even on songs like Oleo.<br /><br />This was recorded in December 1977 for the Galaxy label (Garland cut two albums for that label that month and both featured Ron Carter on bass, so I disagree that there is any tension in this (or the other) recording. Carter is where he should be musically on these tracks as well as in the mix.

5.0,An essential Kenny Burrell album,"This is possibly my favorite Burrell album, although I have so many of his albums and compilations featuring him that I would be hard pressed to pick an absolute favorite. What I love about this one is his rhythm section (especially Roy Haynes on drums) and the spontaneity of each track. Bassist Richard Davis is also spot on in the rhythm section.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples to get a sense of the flow and how telepathically connected the trio is. Haynes sometimes seems a little busy, but it somehow fits. Davis lays a solid foundation and Burrell just seems to float over the whole thing. I have an instructional video from Burrell that explains his approach to music and guitar and this album epitomizes the advice. Clearly he emphasizes the music using his guitar as a conduit for his deep knowledge of how music should fit together. Of course, he is a master of the instrument as well as a musical genius.<br /><br />This album is possibly from the September 16, 1959 performance. There is an extended version that is called 'Complete Edition' that contains four additional tracks that I believe are from the September 17 performance causing confusion as to whether the original release covered both days. Frankly I do not think it matters, but I am always trying to be as accurate as possible regarding discographies and related information. If you know for certain please comment.<br /><br />One final note: the album captures audience interaction, but not mid song. This adds to the ambiance without detracting from enjoying each note.

5.0,Easy listening that has Stanley Dance's imprint and Hines' playing,"This is a thrift shop find. Mine was in VG condition. This album showcases Hines, but is also a showcase for the accompanying musicians (especially Buck Clayton on trumpet and Budd Johnson on tenor and soprano saxophones.) The rhythm section has Bill Pemberton on bass and Oliver Jackson on drums, both of whom are perfect for the tracks.<br /><br />The music recorded during this 1968 session is actually slightly updated arrangements that would have been common fare in the 20s. I am sure that the producer, Stanley Dance, exerted a lot of influence over both the song selections and arrangement.<br /><br />Since there is no track listing, here is what is on the album:<br />A1 The One I Love 3:29<br />A2 I Love My Baby 3:16<br />A3 Nobody Knows 3:51<br />A4 Saturday 2:28<br />A5 You're Mine, You 3:37<br />A6 Thinking Of You 3:25<br />B1 For Me And My Gal 3:52<br />B2 Shine On Harvest Moon 8:55<br />B3 Back In Your Own Back Yard 3:20<br />B4 Everything Depends On You 2:34<br />B5 Rhythm Sundae 2:36<br /><br />It clocks in at 42:12 and is a little less than three quarters of an hour of Dixieland with a significant face lift. Not corny like the revival albums, because there is a slightly polished and straight-ahead feel, but does not demand your complete attention either. For me that is perfect background music.

5.0,A rare talent and superb piano (and compositions),"I came across this gem by total accident and have been listening to it practically non-stop for two days. Geller recorded this album for the Dot label in Los Angeles in 1954, but it was not released until 1959 - a year after her passing. She was alto saxophonist Herb Geller's wife, and this is one of the few albums that she recorded as a leader.<br /><br />You can hear echoes of Dodo Marmarosa, Al Haig and Bud Powell in her playing, but for the most part her sound is her own. There is a definite bebop vibe, but a lot of power as well in her playing.  On this album she is backed by Leroy Vinnegar on bass and Eldridge 'Bruz' Freeman on drums. Some sources cite Larance Marable as drummer on some tracks. Frankly I know very little about Freeman, although I am more familiar with Marable's style. On this album I cannot tell the difference.<br /><br />Since there is no track listing at the time I am posting this I will included it here:<br />1.  Clash By Night  3:06<br />2.  Close Your Eyes  4:09<br />3.  Mystery Theatre  2:51<br />4.  The Blue Room  2:06<br />5.  Everybody`s Blues  3:02<br />6.  Madam X  2:18<br />7.  Gee Baby, Ain`t I Good To You  2:46<br />8.

5.0,Vinnegar's last album; pianist Jessica Williams is another reason to grab this album,"This was Vinnegar's last recording (at least what I could find), so it is an end mark to an amazing career. I own albums featuring him on bass dating from the 1950s, and my prized possession is a collaboration between him and Nat King Cole's former guitarist Oscar Moore: [[ASIN:B005L3HKOA Presenting Oscar Moore]]<br /><br />What I love about this album is pianist Jessica Williams who is actually in the forefront on this album, and drummer Mel Brown. I know practically nothing about either of them, but am totally impressed with Williams. Brown is an excellent drummer who does get a little busy at times.<br /><br />This album was recorded live on October 26, 1996 at the then Atwater's Restaurant and Bar in the US Bancorp Tower (now called the City Grill) in Portland, OR. You can hear patron chatter in the mix, and some of the tracks are definitely a little lively for a restaurant crowd, but appropriate for the bar patrons. Birk's Works, for example, is not common fare for the dinner crowd, especially with Brown's extended solo, but overall this is an excellent example of what a piano jazz trio should sound like in such a setting.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples on this page for an idea of the music, performances and general sound quality. Despite the chatter in the mix (or,perhaps because of it) I am pleased with this album. If you are a jazz musician - especially a member of a piano trio or lounge act - this album is more than enjoyable music.It's a template for how to entertain in a demanding venue.",[],B00004S7ZL,B00004S7ZL,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-03-01 18:39:47.000,2,False,Happy Thanksgiving!

5.0,A true gem and my introduction to Benny Green,"I stumbled across this at a local bargain bin and grabbed it because of Brown and Hamilton. I honestly did not know anything about Benny Green, but he shines on this album. Indeed, Ray Brown may be leading the trio, but Green is the centerpiece here. Of course I need to say that I am not at all disappointed with Jeff Hamilton on drums. He is one of my inspirations and his performance on this album is perfect and in the moment on each note of each track.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples and you will get an idea of why I am gushing. One of the reasons why I love it is the eclectic nature of the tracks.The title track is a Thad Jones/Mel Lewis piece that was probably picked by Hamilton since Mel Lewis was one of his inspirations, some standards and covers (Cole Porter's Ev'rything I Love and the Ellington medley are highlights), an Oscar Peterson tune - Kelley's Blues - and two of Brown's compositions on tracks 5 and 6. Also, since Green has hints of bebop in his playing I am guessing that he selected Dizzy Gillespie's Con Alma.<br /><br />Another thing that I love is the energy. This is a studio album, but has the vibe of a live performance. The album was recorded in just two days (April 21 and 22, 1994) in Studio A at Signet Sound in Los Angeles. The extremely short time it took to lay it down is testimony to just how connected the trio was, and it shows in the music.",[],B000003D4U,B000003D4U,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-03-07 15:11:02.000,2,False,The best looking house gets the best price!
5.0,On the short list for fans. Excellent studio album circa 1978,"This is a gem for anyone who is a Ray Bryant fan. The album title is a play on Miles Davis' All Blues (also on the album), and the album almost lives up to it. The only non-blues track is the Percy Mayfield composition, Please Send Me Somebody to Love.<br /><br />Sadly there are no sound samples as of the date of my review because describing music is difficult. A sample goes a long way. I will say that All Blues starts out sounding live, but quickly goes into studio mode. It does have the same 6/4 feel as the one Miles had recorded for Kind of Blue, but the piano style is pure Ray Bryant.<br /><br />All of the tracks are tight, swinging and energetic. Bryant is backed by Sam Jones on bass and Grady Tate on drums. All three are telepathically and musically locked in. This is like an homage to Ellington, Davis, Lester Young and Charlie Parker based on the track composers, although tracks 1 and 6 are Bryant compositions.<br /><br />This album was recorded at the RCA Studios in NYC in a single session on April 10, 1978.

5.0,"Not an essential album, but definitely an enjoyable one","I am not sure why this album eluded me for so long. I discovered it looking for albums featuring Philly Joe Jones, who is a curious choice for drummer on this one given Monk's penchant for drummers with a lighter touch. But this is Clark Terry's album with Monk as a sideman.<br /><br />Monk does make his presence known, like a proverbial imp escaping a bottle, but he is mainly holding down the rhythm section with some excellent straight ahead comping interspersed with equally straight ahead solo and fill work. He also lays out in some spots when you least expect it.<br /><br />The sound samples on this page are a better gauge of the music than written descriptions, so I recommend that you use those as a guide. There is one song that I do love, though: One Foot in the Gutter. I am intrigued by the seamless way the 4/4 A section switches to 3/4. I am more intrigued by the chord changes that feel unresolved. I cannot explain it since my knowledge of theory can be fit in a peanut shell, but there is something that throws me. I did not even catch it until my fourth of fifth run through the album.<br /><br />Six of the ten tracks are Terry's own compositions (tracks 1, 2,5, 6, 8 and 10), with a single composition by Monk (track 4).<br /><br />This was recorded for Riverside in NYC on May 7 and 12, 1958. In addition to Terry, Monk and Philly Joe Jones, Sam Jones is in the rhythm section as bassist. This may not be essential Monk (or even Terry), but if you are a fan of either or both you will probably enjoy the album.",[],B000000YGX,B000000YGX,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-03-27 14:42:19.000,5,False,A Celebration of Kinship
5.0,A gem that I've only recently discovered,"William Faust's very helpful December 25, 2000 review covers the background of this album beautifully. Indeed, he provides information not found in the usual discographies.<br /><br />The best way to judge this album is to listen to the sound samples on this page. Those were not available when Mr. Faust wrote his review, but they do convey the essence of this album. What you will not hear in the samples is drummer Ed Thigpen 'cutting loose' on a few tracks. Not really solos, but certainly more forceful than his usual subdued (but very tasteful) style. He also treats you to some of this exquisite brushwork, and if you are a jazz drummer that alone makes this album worthwhile.<br /><br />Ray Brown on bass and Peterson are telepathically connected, which was the norm for them. Their interplay on every track, along with Thigpen's contributions, are clear and properly placed in the mix. In fact, this is probably one of the best examples of how to mix a piano jazz trio with the instruments at optimum volume levels where there is a balance and - no pun intended - a harmony in the sound quality.<br /><br />I would not say that this is an essential album, but if you are a fan or a musician in a piano jazz trio you will definitely want to grab it. Five solid stars for both music and sound quality.",[],B0000021AO,B0000021AO,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-04-21 15:45:31.000,2,False,Choose to feel good!
5.0,High energy and definitely should be on any jazz fan's short list,"I do not know how this gem slipped by me for so long, but better late than never.<br /><br />The product description and the sound samples on this page are all you actually need to make a decision, but I do want to add some additional information. First, the overall sound quality is spectacular for a live recording. It comes close to studio quality, but still has the level of energy that only a live recording can generate. Of course, both Peterson and Brown are renown for their high level of intensity when performing - live or studio - so their presence guarantees energy.<br /><br />Milt Jackson comes across as having the shackles of the MJQ removed. I love the entire MJQ, but hearing him cut loose on this album is a real treat. You can also hear how deeply the blues is infused in his playing (something that is difficult to detect on his MJQ performances and recordings.) Plus he can swing with the best of them.<br /><br />Karriem Riggins on drums is a delight too. He definitely adds to the ensemble and has awesome jazz chops. Listening to him here one would never suspect that he is also a hip hop producer (and has been since in his teens!)<br /><br />This was recorded live at the Blue Note in NYC over the course three nights (November 24 through 26, 1998. It is some of the most exciting straight-ahead jazz I have heard coming from the late 1990s, and is truly a gem that I strongly recommend.",[],B00000JZ10,B00000JZ10,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-04-25 21:58:23.000,6,False,Bon Appetit!
5.0,Harris alone; definitely essential for fans,"Harris live and solo is a real treat. To be sure, his blues is prominent on some tracks (as one would expect), but on other tracks he is almost pensive. If there is one constant, it's his penchant for intros that only start to hint at melodies until he feels like digging in and bestowing the melodies. This is typical Gene Harris and one of the reasons why I own nearly all of his albums, going back to his Three Sounds days in the 1950s.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples on this page for a taste of both the sound quality and his playing. If you are accustomed to Harris in a trio or quartet setting he may sound a little thin at first. However, on subsequent runs through this album you will start to hear his true genius unadorned by other instruments. I will admit that it took me a few listens to truly appreciate this album, but once I did I wished that there were more of Harris solo. In that respect this is a treasure.<br /><br />The grand piano used in this performance is either a Yamaha C7 (7' 6&#34;) or S400  (6' 3&#34;). I am not sure which, but did research it out of curiosity. Both pianos are associated with Maybeck Recital Hall,  which is actually a tiny venue in Berkeley, CA that holds less than forty. That makes it intimate, and the wood paneling in the place adds some warmth. Still, the recording does sound a little on the bright side and that may be the small space (and the large amount of glass in the performance area). Another note for folks who want to document Harris' recorded work: this was recorded on August 3, 1992, and tracks 1, 5 and 8 are Harris' own compositions.",[],B0000006LH,B0000006LH,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-05-04 14:21:33.000,4,False,Culinary Seduction!
5.0,A great collaboration and a wonderful album,"A hidden treasure to be sure, and as a staunch Ellington fan I am almost ashamed of discovering it so late in life. As much as I love Ben Webster, Hawkins is a perfect fit between one of the most amazing Eb saxophone duos in jazz (Harry Carney on baritone and Johnny Hodges on alto). In fact, Hawkins' tone blends perfectly with Carney and Hawkins, which is one of the magical elements of this album.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples on this page to get a glimmer of the alchemy because they convey more than I can possibly describe. Be assured that the full tracks are filled with even more surprises and delights.<br /><br />The full line-up, aside from the saxophone section I mentioned is Ray Nance on cornet and violin and Lawrence Brown on trombone rounding out the front line, with Ellington on piano, Aaron Bell on bass and Sam Woodyard on bass. The music is laid back and a perfect blend of 30s/40s swing and more modern influences from the 50s/early 60s small ensembles that everyone on this date forged separately and together.<br /><br />This album was recorded for Impulse at Rudy van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio in a single session on August 18, 1962. This is one of Ellington's finest small group recordings in my opinion and as loyal I am to Ben Webster who had a lot to do with creating the Ellington sound, I love the contribution Coleman Hawkins makes to this recording.",[],B000003N7P,B000003N7P,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-05-30 00:31:36.000,2,False,Comprehensive Overview!
5.0,The line-up is perfect and the music superb,"I've owned this album for some time in both vinyl and CD formats. Honestly, I will listen to it, get sidetracked by other albums and inevitably come back to it months later and falling in love with it all over again.<br /><br />Chambers and drummer Art Taylor shared a lot of performances and recordings together, so it is not surprising how well they lock in and communicate musically. Having Hank Jones on piano on this album is a great choice. It provides another dimension to Chambers and Taylor - to me anyway, since I have a few albums with them and Red Garland on piano. It's a treat to hear them in a different context.  The real star, though, is Kenny Burrell. Among Jones, Chambers and him, the music sounds a lot fresher than a lot of albums I have from the mid-to-late 1950s. I am especially taken with the interplay between Burrell and Chambers, often with Jones comping behind them and Taylor keeping things moving.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples on this page for an idea of the music and sound quality. To my ears both aspects are superb, and if you are in a rhythm section, you will glean a lot of ideas from every track.<br /><br />With the exception of track 7, which is credited to both Chambers and Burrell, this album is a collection of standards and popular jazz tunes from the period. The album was recorded for Blue Note at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on July 14, 1957 and released three months later.

5.0,My introduction to genius,"I tracked this album down after listening to an interview with one of my favorite 7-string guitarists (Ron Escheté) who cited van Eps as his influence and when on to discuss his genius. This is the first of van Eps' albums I came across and I was instantly taken by his playing.<br /><br />While there are pop tunes on the album I was not put off because van Eps' handling of every song on the album is nothing short of the genius that Ron Escheté claimed him to be. More importantly he was accompanied by a single musician, frank Flynn, who backed him with vibraphone, marimba, and a variety of percussion instruments (including a catalog covered in plastic played with brushes on some of the songs such as I Walk Along.<br /><br />Between van Eps and Flynn there is a lot of studio magic happening that goes beyond van Eps' command of his instrument. The arranging and interpretation by van Eps, and Flynn's inventive backing actually boggles my mind and inspires my own imagination. Perhaps the fact that they were performing pop and having fun instead of being shackled by staid standards is one of the things about this album that I found so refreshing. If you are a musician listening to this album I am fairly certain that it will get the creative juices flowing after you become aware that this is a duo with the percussion member doing all kinds of non-traditional stuff - and pulling it off!<br /><br />This was recorded in two sessions at Capitol's Studio B in Los Angeles. The first session on March 10,1966 produced tracks 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 12, with the rest of the tracks on March 16.",[],B00006AWF4,B00006AWF4,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-06-18 16:03:02.000,2,False,Many are seeking the blessed life!
5.0,Basie alumi keeping the vibe alive in 1957,"You don't have to be a Basie (or even a swing) fan to enjoy this. The music is what Stanley Dance termed mainstream jazz, but he was a little wishful since by the time this album was recorded this style of music was comfortable, but showing its age.  However, it has stood the test of time because here I am sixty-eight years later loving every note.<br /><br />For me  there are three elements that make this magic: (1) great compositions and arrangements, (2) superb musicianship, and (3) one of the best rhythm sections in history. Indeed, With Walter Page on bass, Freddie Green on guitar and Papa Jo Jones on drums all but Basie have reunited on this album to reform the All American Rhythm Section. Nat Pierce is a very competent fill in for Basie and honestly, it's hard to tell the difference between the two here.<br /><br />I love the front line with Basie alumni Paul Quinichette on tenor sax and Shad Collins on trumpet. They both get credit for NOT attempting to be Lester Young and Buck Clayton clones. They have their own tones and styles, and are swinging like only a band comprised of Basie alumni can. At places it's hard to figure out if they are swinging the band or the rhythm section is responsible. It goes back and forth, but with this rhythm section I think it's Pierce/Page/Green/Jones who are the drivers.<br /><br />This album was recorded for Prestige at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio in a single day on October 18, 1957.",[],B000007S90,B000007S90,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-06-22 13:43:42.000,0,False,For Golf Lovers or those new to the game..
5.0,"Excellent follow-on to Quinichette's earlier Basie tribute; expanded ensemble, but swings like you expect","This album is one of a handful that Quinichette recorded as both an homage to Basie (a band in which he served) and as the title implies, a reunion of alumni.  This was recorded about eleven months after he recorded [[ASIN:B000007S90 For Basie]], and although most of the same core personnel are on this album, the addition of another trumpet and a baritone sax gives this album a much larger sound.<br /><br />The line up here is Quinichette on tenor sax, Shad Collins and Buck Clayton on trumpet, Jack Washington on baritone sax, and a rhythm section led by Nat Pierce on piano. Pierce is virtually a Basie clone who comps identically, and has the same rhythmic swing and approach to the instrument. He is backed by Freddie Green on guitar, Eddie Jones on bass (the great Walter Page who was on the earlier album has passed away about seven months before this one was recorded), and Papa Jo Jones on drums. Papa Jo and Green are the original members of the All American Rhythm Section (Page and Basie were the other two members.)<br /><br />The key difference in personnel on the For Basie album and this one is Buck Clayton and Jack Washington are added, and Eddie Jones replaced Page. It's the addition of Clayton and Washington that make the biggest difference. The sound is so much more fuller, but the swing is the equal of the earlier album. You can listen to sound samples on this page (the MP3 version of this album): [[ASIN:B007Z0WBXC Basie Reunion]]. That will give you an idea of the music, which is dripping with Kansas City blues and Basie's style that Nat Pierce pulls off so well.<br /><br />This album was recorded for Prestige at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on September 5, 1958.

5.0,One of Paul Desmond's main influences with a killer rhythm section,"I discovered this treasure at a thrift shop and fell totally in love with Brown's tone, not to to mention the arrangements and backing ensemble. Up front: this is my first time listening to Brown and he sounded so familiar I had to check him out. It turns out that he was one of Paul Desmond's main influences, and if you are a fan then you are going to love this album.<br /><br />The entire ensemble is Brown on alto sax, backed by an incredible rhythm section of lesser knowns (but stellar) musicians. He is backed by  Reginald Ashby on piano, Wally Richardson on  guitar, Bill Pemberton on bass and Clarence Stroman on drums.Frankly I do not recall hearing about any of them, but I am going to track down as much information that I can discover on each because these are first rate musicians in their own right.<br /><br />This album was recorded for Verve in NYC on May 5 and 6, 1959.

5.0,Collette after Chico Hamilton - West Coast jazz at its finest (in my opinion),"To be honest, while some folks would classify this as laid back and 'calm' it swings hard and there are some driving grooves. You can get a taste of the album on the MP3 page at [[ASIN:B0048W3UOO Calm, Cool And Collette]].<br /><br />The tracks are drawn from a TV show (Stars of Jazz produced and broadcast by KABC, Los Angeles), and three albums. The personnel on the first sixteen tracks are Collette on flute, clarinet, and alto and tenor sax, Dick Shreve on piano, John Goodman on bass and Bill Dolney on drums. The remaining tracks feature Collette and Shreve backed by future Dave Brubeck Quartet bassist Gene Wright and Bill Richmond on drums.<br /><br />The first two tracks were recorded at the ABC Studios in Los Angeles for the TV broadcast on November 19, 1956, with tracks 3 through 5 at the same studio on November 29. Those last tracks were recorded for the album titled Nice Day with Buddy Collette for the Contemporary label. Tracks 6 through 16 were recorded at the same studio on January 24, 1957 for ABC Paramount for the title album (Calm, Cool and Collette.)<br /><br />Tracks  17-20 were recorded in Los Angeles for the Challenge label on May 14, 1957 and released on the album titled Everybody's Buddy.<br /><br />If you are a Collette (or jazz flute) fan and want some music that still swings with a beat, but are not in the mood for hard bop, this album hits the spot.",[],B001PQNBK4,B001PQNBK4,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-07-19 17:00:04.000,1,False,Lightweight
5.0,Wonderful arrangements with a very full sound,"Every track on this album is superbly arranged and performed. It reminds me of albums from the mid 50s through early 60s that were often focused on musicals and Broadway tunes. What I love about this is how Braff's cornet and Barnes' guitar lock on, and the way that Wayne Wright and<br />Michael Moore form the perfect rhythm section on guitar and bass, respectively.<br /><br />This is definitely mellow, mood music. It doesn't quite reach the level of romantic music because the swing is definite, and Moore's bass, albeit subtle, manages a pulse that inspires one to tap their foot more than gaze into the eyes of their partner. Well, that's my take anyway. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />If you are a drummer who wants a great play-along for practicing brushes, this album is perfect. If you study this album you will find that the arrangements can be further distilled down to two guitars of both guitarists are well versed in harmony and rhythm. However, to my ears Braff's cornet adds a dimension to the music that is magic.<br /><br />This album was recorded for the Concord label at A&R Studios in NYC during October 1974 and released the next year. It's a shame there are no sound samples because the sound is both unique and very full considering there is a cornet backed by two guitars and a bass.",[],B0000006RZ,B0000006RZ,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-07-19 17:25:57.000,0,False,Best World Atlas on the Planet

All of the sessions were in Los Angeles during early January 1957.

On tracks A1 and A2, and B1 and B2 the bassist is Red Mitchell and the drummer is Alvin Stoller. On the remaining tracks from that album the bassist is Joe Mondragon and the drummer is Larry Bunker. These sessions on January 3 and 4, and 7 and 8, 1957.<br /><br />For Body and Soul the sessions took place on January 4, 7 and 9, 1957, so both albums share some sessions.

Both albums were recorded for the Venus label and feature Higgins backed by Jay Leonhart on bass and the late, great Joe Ascione on drums.<br /><br />Disc One is Bewitched, which was recorded in The Studio in NYC in a mere two days (January 30 and 31, 2001.)  Disc Two is Dear Old Stockholm, which was recorded in Avatar Studios in NYC. Again, this album was cut in just two days: September 24 and 25, 2002.<br /><br />Sound quality is excellent, and the musicianship is absolutely superb.

5.0,Higgins and Trio get a new dimension with Hamilton on tenor,"This is an absolute cooking session. I am a fan of both Higgins and Hamilton (who also recorded with two of my other favorite pianists: Gene Harris and Rossano Sportiello), as well as the late Joe Ascione who is the drummer on this album. I may as well mention bassist Jay Leonhart on the album because I have other Higgins albums that feature him paired with Ascione and they are a powerful rhythm section.<br /><br />The track selection is well chosen and the sound quality is superb to my ears. I am not going to give a track-by-track description because that would only subjectively reflect my tastes. I will say that while Hamilton has his own style, you can hear a lot of Ben Webster in his playing. Virile, but masterful and tender when he is playing ballads. Higgins/Leonhart/Ascione could have done this album as a trio and easily pulled it off, but Hamilton adds so much that we are fortunate they recorded this as a quartet. It borders on sensual on many tracks, and Higgins and rhythm section could not have pulled that off by themselves.<br /><br />This was recorded for the Venus label at Avatar Studios in NYC on September 11 and 12, 2004. Higgins seems to do most of his albums in two sessions, which is remarkable in this day and age - especially since many clock in at over an hour (this one is 68 minutes long.)",[],B0029NYFFM,B0029NYFFM,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-07-31 02:42:39.000,3,False,My favorite Flash Cards in this series...
5.0,Beautiful arrangements and performances; Pizzarelli's 7-string adds a nice dimension to the music,"This is one of my favorite Higgins albums in my growing collection. Although this is not the first (nor last) time that he performed as a piano-bass-guitar trio, the arrangements here imply that there is a drummer. There isn't.  Perhaps it's the fact that John Pizzarelli is using a 7-string guitar; perhaps on tracks where it sounds or comes across that there is a drummer with brushes, Pizzarelli used that old country trick of interleaving a dollar bill through the strings on the fretboard. Regardless, the is a definite percussive pulse that drives some track as though you are listening to a quartet.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples on this page to get an idea about the music. I rarely try to describe tracks because I tend to drift into opinions and subjective areas. You will know immediately whether or not this album is your cup of tea from the brief sound snippets. Like many of Higgins' albums that I own, this one is filled with standards and the usual fare. It's to music what comfort foods are to cuisine, and the performances and arrangements are so well done that it's like comfort foods prepared by a renowned chef. There is one track that is Higgins' own composition: 6.<br /><br />The bassist is Jay Leonhart who is no stranger to Higgins. He is on a number of Higgins albums that I own and the connection between the two shows through in the performance.  Pizzarelli is totally integrated into the group as well. Plus, the sound quality is up to the Venus label's high standards.<br /><br />This was recorded for Venus at Current Sounds in NYC on February 18 and 19, 2000 (typically Higgins records nearly all of his albums in two days.)",[],B0029NYF8Y,B0029NYF8Y,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-07-31 21:44:35.000,1,False,Compact and very useful!
5.0,Highlight is the interplay between Hank Jones and Kenny Burrell; excellent music and arranging,"I've owned  this album for quite some time and decided to pull it out and listen with fresh ears. While this is not exactly a 'must-have' album, the musicianship is uniformly excellent and the arranging is masterful. Every track is based on a musical titled Here's Love, all of which were originally composed by Meredith Willson. There is where the arrangements shine because orchestral pieces have been distilled down into jazz quartet format and they sound rich and full.<br /><br />The sound samples on this page will provide enough information to get a good sense of the music. The center of the music is Hank Jones' piano and Kenny Burrell's guitar. Both take turns with melody and harmony, and create some real studio magic (hence, the five stars.)  Milt Hinton on bass and Hank's brother Elvin on drums are the perfect rhythm section. If you are a bassist focus on Hinton. He makes it sound simple and easy, but he is doing some incredible things that make the piano and guitar stand out. Elvin is masterful, especially on brushes, but he does have a few moments when he seems to over play. It does not detract from the music, and after a few listens I cannot imagine a more perfect drummer for this album.<br /><br />This was recorded for the Argo label at Rudy van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio in a single session on October 19, 1963. While musicians will find this album to be rich in ideas, especially the interplay between piano and guitar, anyone who loves jazz quartets will probably love this album.",[],B000060N5O,B000060N5O,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-08-02 11:57:44.000,1,False,Educational and Fun!
5.0,"One of four spectacular albums recorded during a marathon session October 14 through 17, 2006","Spectacular playing by Higgins accompanied and backed by Jay Leonhart on bass and Mark Taylor on drums. I will confess that my favorite drummer who was frequently a member of Higgins' trios was Joe Ascione, but Taylor is perfect on this album. If you are a Higgins fan, then you are probably familiar with Leonhart who is almost telepathically connected to Higgins.<br /><br />At the time of this review there are no sound samples. You can get a hint of both the performance and sound quality by listening to the samples on [[ASIN:B013P6QN2Y A Fine Romance]], which was one of four albums Higgins, Leonhart and Taylor recorded in a marathon set of sessions for the Venus label at the Clinton Recording Studios in NYC during October 14 through 17, 2006. I own all four albums, and the consistency among the four is as though they recorded them the same day.<br /><br />Another thing about this and the other three albums is the objective was to pick and record fifty standards that Higgins had never recorded. Among those fifty tracks I would have to say that most of my personal favorites are on this album. If you are a Higgins (or jazz piano trio) fan this is a worthwhile album.

If you run through the sound samples you can get a taste of the music as well as the sound quality (which is superb to my ears.)<br /><br />This was recorded, along with three other albums, in a four day set of sessions for the Venus label at the Clinton Recording Studios in NYC during October 14 through 17, 2006. The companion albums are [[ASIN:B0029NYFK2 A Lovely Way To Spend An Evening]], [[ASIN:B0029NYFMU Secret Love]], and [[ASIN:B0029NYFJS A Fine Romance]]. The music across these albums is consistent in sound and performance. The tracks were reputedly selected because Higgins had not recorded them previously. I have not verified that, but the trio is tight and the music swings.<br /><br />The bassist backing Higgins is Jay Leonhart, who is on many of his albums. The drummer is Mark Taylor. I am not as familiar with Taylor as I am with Joe Ascione who also served as Higgins' drummer on many albums, but I can attest that Taylor is perfect for the drum chair on every album from the session. I am especially fond of his brushwork and most subdued approach.<br /><br />If you are an Eddie Higgins fan this, and the other three albums mentioned above, are definitely up to his high standards of arrangements and performance. I think you will be pleased. If you are just discovering Higgins this album is a safe choice.",[],B0029NYFNY,B0029NYFNY,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-08-11 03:06:56.000,1,False,>^..^&lt;
5.0,"Solid West Coast fare, a highlight for drummers is Mel Lewis' brushwork on many tracks","Up front: the only reason why I am rating this album so highly is Mel Lewis' brushwork is prominent in the mix on tracks on which he is playing brushes, and I found it inspiring. Otherwise, this is more of a four star effort.  The musicianship is excellent, and this is typical west coast fare from the era, but not  especially spectacular.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples on this page to get a feel for both the music and sound quality. I think both are strong points in favor of this album. I have long been a fan of Rowles because he has a touch and sound that was refined by backing some of the great female jazz vocalists. It shows in his playing here.<br /><br />The lead melody provided by Lee Katzman on trumpet, Bob Enevoldsen on trombone, Bill Holman on baritone and tenor sax, and Herb Geller on baritone and alto sax is an interesting mix that covers the low register to the upper. While Rowles is both in front and in the rhythm section, depending on arrangements, he is ably supported in the rhythm section by Monty Budwigon bass who is locked in with Lewis on drums.<br /><br />This was recorded for the Andex label at Radio Recorders in Los Angeles on December 13, 1958. The original release only included the first nine tracks; the alternate takes were added when this was rereleased on CD.",[],B000003BBL,B000003BBL,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-08-12 01:21:14.000,1,False,Colorful Everyday Objects
5.0,"Lowe is the centerpiece here, but the arrangements, track selection and ensemble make this a great album","This was recorded live for the Telarc label at Copley Symphony Hall in San Diego, CA on August 24, 1991. The music ranks up there as one of the most beautiful performances that I have enjoyed in a long time. I particularly like the fact that this is a drummerless piano trio in the tradition of Nat King Cole and early Oscar Peterson format of piano-guitar-bass.<br /><br />Every musician contributed equally in my opinion, but I have to agree with another reviewer who thought Lowe was the star. He seemed to have purposely been given a prominent spot in the arrangements.  That said, this would not have been the same, lush (and swinging) album without Previn's piano and Brown's bass.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples and you will get an idea of the music. The recording quality is very good (although not exceptional), and the audience clapping added ambience of a live performance. During each track the audience was respectfully quiet, which is refreshing.  Previn does set some ground rules about that as an intro on the first track.<br /><br />The track selection, arrangements and performance earns this album a solid five stars in my book.",[],B000003D38,B000003D38,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-08-13 14:08:07.000,3,False,Colorful Guide
4.0,Wilson circa 1959 - standard fare with competent backing by Arvel Shaw on bass and Bert Dahlander on drums,"This is one of my thrift shop discoveries. Although my LP was in pristine condition, the sound quality is a little spotty, especially for vinyl. This is one of the few albums that would have probably fared better had it been remastered and transferred to CD.<br /><br />That said, this is typical Teddy Wilson, with his light silvery touch. The track selections are fairly standard for Wilson, which is another reason why I did not award it a total five stars. He is accompanied by Arvel Shaw on bass and Bert Dahlander on drums. I am not totally familiar with Dahlander, but do love his style. Shaw, to me, is a known quantity and is perfect on this album.<br /><br />Since there are no tracks listed at the time of this review, here are the tracks and times (the album clocks in at 35:55):<br />A1  Rose Room  3:31<br />A2  Just One Of Those Things  3:37<br />A3  Shiny Stockins  3:31<br />A4  Body And Soul  1:45<br />A5  Sweet Lorraine  1:09<br />A6  Moonglow  3:27<br />B1  But Not For Me  5:26<br />B2  Nice Work If You Can Get It  5:14<br />B3  It Had To Be You  5:18<br />B4  Someone To Watch Over Me  2:10<br /><br />I could not find any dates or places with regard to this recording. It is circa 1959 (some sources cite 1960), and could have been recorded just about anywhere.  Regardless, if you are a Wilson fan, this is not a bad buy, but I would not call it essential by any means.",[],B00E3T3F74,B00E3T3F74,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-08-17 00:11:29.000,0,False,Dream Kitchens
5.0,Musicians will find many nuggets and insights.  Casual listeners will probably be disappointed,"There is something about this album that make up for its many flaws (sound quality, patchwork snippets of tunes). For me the reason why I gave it five stars is because it gave me a feeling of eavesdropping on the creative process being forged by Evans and Elliott.  It is also a glimpse into Evans without the filters of a produced album and post production. If you are a musician this is going to be more valuable than to a casual listener. In fact, for casual listeners this is more a two- or three-star album.<br /><br />Interestingly, I found Evans more interesting here than on some of his later albums.  His discussion of time and freedom in the form of banter and off-hand comments to Elliott give some insights and explains why Paul Motian would later fit Evans' work so well. Until this album I never quite got it.<br /><br />Here it's just Evans and Elliott. No bass, and the only percussion is the vibraphone and some scatting by Elliott. I've listened to this multiple times from different perspectives. The connection, musically, between Evans and Elliott is more sophisticated than the first few listens would have indicated. The hopping around, and starts and stops are where their thought processes surface, and to me that is invaluable. Again, if you are considering this just to listen to Evans play, you are probably not going to like it.<br /><br />This was recorded in Elliott's Connecticut studio during 56-57 and the aggregate of sessions that made it to this album clocks in at 56:37. I have no idea what was cut (if anything), but I hope it was not discussions and banter because those to me are what make this so valuable.",[],B00005LMJZ,B00005LMJZ,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-08-25 03:19:48.000,1,False,Creative!
5.0,Truly all star ensemble with heavy blues influence and enjoyable listening,"I hit the jackpot with this album because I am an avid fan of every musician on it, especially Gene Harris. I probably own ninety percent of Harris' recorded works, starting with his Three Sounds years.<br /><br />Since there are sound samples on this page I'll refrain from attempting to describe the music and let those convey the essence of this album. There are some interesting dynamics happening - especially with the pairing of Harris and Hamilton who have worked well on a number of albums, and the synergy between Brown and Ellis whose long personal and professional histories go back to the 1950s when they were the rhythm section of Oscar Peterson's early trios. Harold Jones on drums is one of my influences. He first caught my attention during his stint with Count Basie (who always had great drummers), but his work backing vocalists from Ella, Carmen, Tony Bennett and others is what inspired me to study his technique. He does not disappoint on this album!<br /><br />Although this album contains standards and familiar works, it's Harris' blues-infused playing that defines it. When you add in Ray Brown's intense bass, Hamilton's lyrical tenor sax, and the way Ellis fleshes out melodies and harmonies the music is the sonic equivalent of comfort food. Of course Jones' tasteful drumming adds a lot to it as well.<br /><br />This was recorded for Concord at Coast Recorders in San Francisco during May 1990. The sound quality is excellent, as are the musicianship and the music itself. This more enjoyable listening than anything truly profound, but sometimes that is what I personally need, and that makes this a favorite in my play rotation.",[],B0000006J2,B0000006J2,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-08-25 15:35:53.000,2,False,The First American Cookbook written by a woman
5.0,Jazz funk showing off Gatton's chops against a master,"A friend recommended this album and to me it's an absolute delight. I am a fan of both Danny Gatton and Joey D, and was surprised to discover that they did a collaboration. Better late than never.<br /><br />This is not straight ahead jazz by any means. It's more in line with 'funk jazz' a la some of Jimmy Smith's later work. Surprisingly there is a bassist on this album, which I did not expect since Joey D is on B3. The bassist is John Previti, with whom Gatton had played in the past. The drummer is Timm Biery, who also was associated with Gatton (and was his drummer during Gatton's last years in the 1990s.)<br /><br />The music cooks, in large part to Joey D, but also Gatton's inventiveness and talent for improvising on the spot. Of course the rhythm section kept things moving and, surprisingly, there is little conflict between DeFrancesco and Previti.<br /><br />If you doubt Gatton's jazz chops do a search for 'Danny Gatton at Holiday Inn. Arlington VA. 9/27/87'. The resulting video should lay that notion to rest. It also has John Previti, so you will be treated to not only Gatton in a pure jazz setting, but the bassist on this album as well.<br /><br />Interestingly, this was recorded by Ed Eastridge who captured the session from his Big Mo studio (a truck!) The sound quality is excellent, and the playing is a great example of jazz funk. Listen to the sound samples for a taste. Also, tracks 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8 are Gatton's own compositions, and track 6 is co-written by Gatton.",[],B0000020UP,B0000020UP,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-08-26 16:41:44.000,2,False,The Scent of Freshly Baked Bread'
5.0,Historic set containing some of Brown's last recorded works,"A treasure! I have all of these tracks on other compilations, but having them in this set is a convenience (for me.) The sound quality is excellent and it is a chunk of Brown's recordings before his untimely passing. Both albums share the same line-up, which features Clifford Brown on trumpet accompanied by Sonny Rollins on tenor sax, and backed by a rhythm section comprised of Richie Powell (Bud's brother who also perished in the same accident that took Brown's life), George Morrow on bass and Max Roach on drums.<br /><br />The first nine tracks were recorded at the Basin Street East club in NYC on January 4 and February 16, 1956. You can listen to sound samples in this album, which is the original release plus repeats of some songs: [[ASIN:B000VRNCDY Clifford Brown and Max Roach at Basin Street]].<br /><br />Remaining tracks were recorded at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio for Prestige on March 22, 1956. You can listen to sound samples of that album here: [[ASIN:B000UB32AO Plus Four [Rudy Van Gelder edition] (Remastered)]].<br /><br />Together these represent some of Brown's last recorded work (the Plus Four album was his last studio album), and these two albums have a cohesive feel since they were recorded so close together by the same personnel.  I am on the fence regarding proclaiming these to be essential albums, but they are historic in their own right.",[],B000K15UGI,B000K15UGI,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-09-04 03:10:09.000,2,False,P-r-e-t-t-y Amazing
5.0,Davis in straight-ahead context backed by a crack rhythm section,"This is one of my better thrift shop finds and a real surprise. The sound quality is excellent. The entire album is a live recording from The First Independent Jazz Festival in Massy, France. The set is from Thursday, October 23, 1975 and there is enough crowd noise to make you feel as though you were there.<br /><br />Davis is in excellent form on the standards that were chosen. Here are the tracks:<br /><br />SIDE A 26:41<br />A1  Cherokee (7:48)<br />A2  Stomping at the Savoy (6:47)<br />A3  Ghost of a chance (4:04)<br />A4  Green Dolphin Street (6:59)<br />SIDE B  26:37<br />B1  Avalon (6:21)<br />B2  I can't get started (4:20)<br />B3  Tangerine (5:20)<br />B4  Oh, gee! (5:14)<br /><br />One of the reasons why I love this album is Davis is playing straight-ahead and is backed my an excellent rhythm section led by Georges Arvanitas on piano, Jacky Sampson on bass and Charles Saudrais on drums. Arvanitas is the real co-star here. I have recordings of him backing everyone from Art Farmer to Anita O'Day (and just about every jazz expat who moved to Europe.)  Samson and Saudrais are also excellent.<br /><br />I have a few other Davis albums and this one tops my list of favorites.

5.0,A glimpse into Evans' genius - a must listen for arrangers and composers,"This album is evidence of pure genius.  I've long been a fan or Evans' arrangements and compositions, but to me this is the pinnacle. The first track is by far the longest, but is also the most complex. On the surface it sounds simple and repetitive, but as it unfolds there is an intricate structure that becomes evident, and an amazing ending. The rest of the tracks have Evans' special arranging magic as well. Tracks 1 and 5 are his own compositions, but it's the arranging that shines on all of them.<br /><br />Normally when an album has sound samples I simply invite folks to let those convey the music. In this case there is no way that is possible. I will say that you can get a hint, but you need to grab this album for the true beauty of the work.  If you are a musician, and especially a composer or arranger, this album is like taking a post graduate course. If you love great music that defies classification you will probably love this as well.<br /><br />The arrangements are based on a large ensemble:  the brass has Johnny Coles and Phil Sunkel on trumpet, Keg Johnson and Jimmy Knepper on trombone, Tony Studd on bass trombone and Bill Barber on tuba. The reed and wind section has Bud Johnson on tenor and soprano sax, Ray Beckenstein and Eddie Caine on alto sax, flute and piccolo, and Bob Tricarico on flute, piccolo and bassoon. The rhythm section features Evans on piano, Ray Crawford on guitar, Ron Carter on bass, and Elvin Jones and Charli Persip on drums and percussion.<br /><br />This was recorded for the Impulse label at Rudy van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio on November 18 and 30, 1960 (tracks 2, 4 and 5), and December 10 and 15, 1960 (tracks 1, 3 and 6).",[],B000003N8E,B000003N8E,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-09-14 02:57:05.000,2,False,In Addition to your Workout Videos
5.0,"Kelly and Chambers headline this set, with some great drumming and fuller arrangements on the first six tracks","This is a bargain set that at its core features Paul Chambers on bass and Wynton Kelly on piano on both albums. Philly Joe Jones is the drummer on one track on the album titled GO, and all of the tracks on Kelly at Midnight. Both albums were recorded for the Vee-Jay label.<br /><br />On GO, tracks 1 through 6, the ensemble is fronted by Freddie Hubbard on trumpet and Cannonball Adderly on alto sax, backed by Kelly, Chambers and Jimmy Cobb on drums (except on Awful Mean, which features Philly Joe Jones.) This album was recorded  over three sessions in early February 1959 in Chicago.<br /><br />The remaining tracks are the album titled Kelly at Midnight, which features scaled down arrangements for a piano led by Kelly with Chambers and Philly Joe Jones forming the rhythm section. This album was recorded in a single session at Bell Sound Studios in NYC on April 27, 1960.<br /><br />Sound quality is excellent, and the music is a study in arrangements with the first tracks fuller with brass and reed taking over the main melody, while the remaining tracks showcase the power of Kelly, Chambers and Jones as a driving trio.

The dates are September 25 and 26, and October 6,1959 (for those of us who track such things.<br /><br />The sound samples showcase Baker who is playing more uptempo tunes, but the real surprise to me is the Italian alto saxophonist, Glauco Masetti, who is tearing it up and appears to be nudging Baker, The synergy between the two is why I rated this so highly. That and the sound quality, which is excellent to my ears.<br /><br />In addition to Baker and Masetti, the ensemble includes Gianni Basso on tenor sax (no slouch himself) and a rock solid rhythm section comprised of Renato Sellani on piano, Franco Cerri on bass, and Gene Victory on drums. No vocals, but a very forceful performance and Baker at his best accompanied and backed by some simpatico musicians.",[],B00000DMHE,B00000DMHE,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-09-17 20:21:10.000,0,False,Show me the way back to the sea
5.0,Not all tracks feature Powell or Johnson - this foreshadows hard bop by five years,"It's a shame there are no sound samples (at the time of this review) because describing the music in words is difficult at best. What I hear in this album, from a rhythm perspective, is a precursor to hard bop that would emerge somewhere around 1954-55. The drumming is a lot less choppy (in large part thanks to Max Roach's participation here), and is even different from what Max would be playing in 1953 on the Jazz at Massey Hall album.<br /><br />That aside, the phrasing is distinctly different from the original bebop style of just four years earlier, which is another clue that the music on this album (and in the East Coast scene) was in a state of transition.<br /><br />This album is actually the original as issued by Prestige in 1957, plus five bonus tracks (tracks 6, 11, 13, 15 and 17.) More importantly, Bud Powell is only on the first nine tracks with John Lewis on the remaining eight, and J.J. Johnson is absent from the first nine tracks. The core is Sonny Stitt on tenor sax and Max Roach on drums, both of whom are on every track. Curly Russell is on bass on the first nine tracks, with Nelson Boyd on the last eight.  Surprisingly, the album is cohesive despite the personnel changes, and the sound quality is better than I expected from tracks that were recorded in 1949-1950.<br /><br />The entire album was recorded in NYC in three different sessions. The first nine tracks were recorded on  December 11, 1949 and January 26, 1950,  and tracks 10 through 17 were recorded on October 17, 1949.",[],B000000Y0C,B000000Y0C,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-09-19 14:08:57.000,1,False,Nautical Fever

This should be required listening for not only jazz guitarists, but jazz musicians who want to change up the traditional jazz piano trio format to jazz guitar trio (or quartet or more.)<br /><br />The core is at least one guitarist, bass (John Clayton) and drums (John Von Ohlen). On many tracks there are two or more guitarists, and the rhythm section. On tracks 1, 5, 7, 8 and 10 Mel Rhyne is on organ. The music is laid back, but beautifully played. There are some major chops displayed, and on many tracks there is a gold mine of harmonic ideas.<br /><br />Here are the guitarists featured on each track: 1, Royce Campbell and Jimmy Raney; 2, Cal Collins and Herb Ellis; 3, Royce Campbell and Tal Farlow; 4, Cal Collins; 5, Royce Campbell, 6, Herb Ellis; 7, Jimmy Raney; 8, Jimmy Raney and Royce Campbell; 9, Royce Campbell; 10, Jimmy Raney; 11, Cal Collins, Herb Ellis, Royce Campbell and Tal Farlow.<br /><br />This was recorded for the Evidence label at LRS Studios in Cincinnati, OH on April 6, 1992 and at September Recording Studio in Indianapolis, IN on May 4, 1992.",[],B0000014LG,B0000014LG,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-09-21 00:58:37.000,0,False,Cleanliness is next to Godliness
5.0,"Sounds easy and laid back, but the arrangements and playing are both intricate and complex as you dig into the music","This album is another of my favorite Baker albums from his final decade. The music is pensive, beautifully arranged and performed, and is perfect for a romantic setting or just chilling out.<br /><br />The sound samples are more than sufficient to convey the essence of each track. There are no surprise intros, outros or bridges. The melody floats along, and Doug Raney's guitar adds a beautiful harmonic layer, as well as contributing to both melody and rhythm. Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen is his usual, tasteful self on bass, and his playing here evidences why he was loved by greats such as Oscar Peterson,Dexter Gordon, Bill Evans and others in a list of luminaries too long to cite here.<br /><br />One thing I especially love is this is drummerless. Baker was picky about drummers, and would not use a drummer unless he or she was exceptional.  Aside from learning drum arrangements sans drummers, this is an excellent play-along album for me.<br /><br />This was recorded for the Steeple Chase label in Copenhagen during a single session on June 21, 1979.

5.0,Her next to last album in a too short life and career,"This was Remler's next to last album (she butwould be gone two years after the May 1988 recording session.) This is truly a tribute to both Wes Montgomery and Herb Ellis, although, strangely none of the songs are associated with either guitarist. Tracks 6 and 8, however, are Remler's own compositions that are tributes to both of of them.<br /><br />The remaining tracks are an interesting mix of Clifford Brown (track 1) and Tadd Dameron compositions (tracks 1 and 3), and standards. The sound samples convey what this album is all about, but the real essence is in the extended tracks, none of which are less than five minutes, and the improvisational genius and playing by Remler backed by a crack rhythm section led by Hank Jones on piano, Buster Williams on bass and Marvin 'Smitty' Smith on drums. They add a lot to this album - especially Jones who is one of the most prolific and respected jazz pianists of his era.<br /><br />This was recorded for the Concord label at Penny Lane Studios in NYC in May 1988 and released in September the same year. This was Remler's sixth album in as many years, and since she would only record a total of seven in her short life I consider this (and the others) to be essential.",[],B0000006H6,B0000006H6,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-09-24 17:53:51.000,1,False,Building a life of confident learning...
5.0,Early soul jazz with a touch of funk and a lot of hard swing,"This is truly a transitional album for jazz. One reason is the free jazz and modal movements that came to the fore in 1959, Trane's excursions and other factors were changing the nature of the music. This album represents the branch that would evolve into 'soul jazz.' Actually, that was practically guaranteed when Stanley Turrentine and Les Mcann were paired because Turrentine had a strong penchant for blues, and McCann had a style that was both funky and soulful.<br /><br />The sound samples on this page are more than sufficient to convey the music. Run through those if you are not already  familiar with this album (or Turrentine or McCann.)<br /><br />Another factor that adds to the soul/funk quality is the core rhythm section. Bassist Herbie Lewis was already associated with McCann and his distinct style that was evolving even before this album was recorded.  Drummer Otis Finch was working for Turrentine's wife, organist Shirley Scott, who was also going down the soul jazz path.<br /><br />One thing that characterizes the music over soul jazz as it would evolve into is the hard swing. In that respect the music seems to share a lot with what Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and other groups were still doing, but with a more commercial feel.<br /><br />Another thing that is unique is Blue Note allowed all of the tracks to be original compositions:  McCann contributed tracks 1, and 3 through 5, Turrentine contributed track 2, and his brother, trumpeter Tommy, penned Light Blue. Tommy is not on the album, and frankly I am not that the arrangements would have worked as well with a trumpet anyway.<br /><br />This was recorded in a single session at Rudy van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio on January 2, 1962.

5.0,"This is one of those love or hate albums, but very unique for McPartland","Interesting album (to say the least!) This is way outside McPartland's territory in my opinion because she used a Wurlitzer electric piano on a few tracks. I am on the fence about it from a musical perspective, but have to applaud her for thinking out of the box since electric pianos were rarely (if ever) used in jazz in 1963.<br /><br />Another interesting thing about this album is the arrangements. McPartland is backed by a rhythm section with Ben Tucker on bass and a percussion ensemble comprised of Dave Bailey on drums, Ralph Dorsey on congas and Bob Crowder on tambourine. In her liner notes McPartland explained that she was inspired by Dizzy Gillespie to add Crowder, and he was added at the last minute unrehearsed.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples to get the gist of this album. Most folks I know either love or hate it. I actually love it because it's so unexpected for a McPartland led album. I also love the song selections, which lend themselves nicely to Bossa Nova arrangements. Also note that two songs are McPartland compositions (With You In Mind and Stranger in a Dream), and two are Ben Tucker compositions (Coming Home Baby and Baby You Should Know It.)",[],B002YK47LW,B002YK47LW,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-09-30 16:43:43.000,4,False,Tins filled with cookies'.
5.0,"Lacks the fire of Albany's early work, but the playing is distinctly his and the album a great listen","This is not the young and exciting Joe Albany, but what this album lacks in fire it makes up in steady, mature musicianship. Frankly, his choice of songs and his no-risk interpretation is enjoyable to my ears. There are times when I want to listen to music performed without pyrotechnics and cleverness. This album fits that mold.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples and it's apparent that Albany has not sold out. His unique sound is there, but the arrangements focus on melody and the essence of each song. It's the song selection that makes this album special to me. There are standards by Berlin, Lerner, Kahn, et al, but there is an Albany composition (track 3), as well as ones by Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk (tracks 6 and 7).<br /><br />Albany is backed by bassist George Duvivier and drummer Charlie Persip, and accompanied on some tracks by guitarist Al Gafa. The final track is a short interview conducted by Mike Berniker who also produced all of the tracks except for track 6, and who wrote the liner notes.<br /><br />This was recorded for the Elektra label at CBS Recording Studios in NYC (except for track 6, which was recorded at Ocean Way Recording in Los Angeles.",[],B001G2S47W,B001G2S47W,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-10-06 03:08:25.000,0,False,Paradoxical Commandments
5.0,Outstanding performance of traditional gospel songs by a great west coast trio,"I love this album for a number of reasons. Foremost is the trio led by Hawes with Leroy Vinnegar on bass and Stan Levey on drums is strong. The arrangements swing and are played with intensity. At the time of this review there are no sound samples unfortunately, but the CD's sound quality is excellent to my ears and does the music justice.<br /><br />All but the last track is traditional gospel. The last track is a Hawes composition in blues form. If you are familiar with Leroy Vinnegar you will immediately pick out his distinctive style. Among the west coast bassists he ranks as one of my personal favorites. Stan Levey is rock solid here. He started out on the east coast (backing Dizzy Gillespie at the tender age of sixteen, and rooming with Bird); here he provides the perfect rhythm and time for the music. He is totally locked into Vinnegar, and both are locked into Hawes.<br /><br />This was recorded for the  Contemporary label at their Los Angeles studio on November 24 and 25, 1958. The album was not released until 1987. Part of the reason may have been because this was Hawes last album in the 1950s - he would not record again until February 1964 after his release from prison. That back story is not relevant other than to provide a possible explanation for why this album took so long to get released. The music is definitely five star material to my ears.",[],B00006310Q,B00006310Q,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-10-06 08:24:37.000,5,False,Protecting Yourself From the Irritations of Life

5.0,Hawes solo with excellent sound quality,"This is classic Hawes, and one of the reasons why I love this album is he is solo. No distracting rhythm section. His touch is simply beautiful and the piano's tone is nice in this recording.<br /><br />Since there is no track list on this page, here it is (it clocks in at 41:29):<br />A1 Hamp's Blues<br />A2 Summertime<br />A3 What's New<br />A4 It Could Happen To You<br />A5 My Romance<br />A6 Autumn Leaves<br />B1 Just One Of Those Things<br />B2 Who Can I Turn To<br />B3 Bag's Groove<br />B4 Clementine<br />B5 Young People's Tune<br />B6 Shinjuku<br /><br />The tracks A1, B5 and B6 are Hawe's compositions. The remaining tracks are exellent vehicles to showcase his versatility and creativity. A prime example is track B4, where he takes the 1884 folk composition, Clementine, and gives it a truly interesting treatment while maintaining the melody.<br /><br />This album was recorded at Iino Hall in Tokyo on May 7, 9 and 12, 1968.

5.0,"First eight tracks are superb; bonus tracks are nice, but not essential","The first eight tracks are from the album titled Quartet: Russ Freeman/Chet Baker that was recorded for World Pacific in Los Angeles on November 6, 1956. Here Baker is backed by Russ Freeman on piano, Leroy Vinnegar on bass and Shelly Manne on drums.<br /><br />Personally, the rhythm section is what makes the above tracks so strong. That is not to say that Baker is weak - he isn't. But there is a synergy among Freeman, Vinnegar and Manne that allows Baker to literally soar. There is a lot of energy and uniformly excellent musicianship on these tracks. In fact, that is why I rated this so highly.<br /><br />Tracks 9 through 13 were recorded at a live concert in Santa Cruz, CA sometime in late July (or late September-October), 1954. Discographies are vague about the exact dates. Baker is backed by Russ Freeman on piano, Carson Smith on bass and Bob Neel on drums.<br /><br />The final tracks are a nice bonus, but the heart and soul of this album are those magic first eight. I definitely recommend the entire album to anyone who loves circa 1950s jazz, West Coast style, or is a Chet Baker fan.",[],B00QW4QX2C,B00QW4QX2C,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-10-10 15:12:22.000,3,False,A Rare Look at a Common Occurrence
5.0,Obscure (but excellent) blues with Chicago and Kansas City seasoning,"I only recently 'discovered' Stidham (and by accident). His earlier recordings from the 1940s/early 50s featured him on sax. Here he is on guitar and his playing is excellent. Of course, it's his singing that makes all of his albums special, regardless of instrument.<br /><br />There are no sound samples as I write this, and it's difficult to describe his playing. I am tempted to say Chicago style blues, but there is more Kansas City to his playing to my ears. You can also hear echoes of Louis Jordan and even Lionel Hampton's band with Illinois Jacquet. Regardless, if you like old school blues you will probably love this album.<br /><br />Curiously, this album was not recorded for one of the mainstream blues labels, but for Prestige's Bluesville label. The session was recorded in a single day on November 7, 1960 at Rudy van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio. Stidham's vocals and guitar are accompanied by King Curtis on tenor sax, and backed by a rhythm section comprised of John Wright on piano, Leonard Gaskin on bass and Armond Jackson on drums.",[],B00005N816,B00005N816,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-10-10 16:09:04.000,2,False,Mystical Romance
5.0,Interesting arrangements (for 1958) a la Chico Hamilton,"When this album was released 1958 it was definitely 'out there' along the same lines as the direction Chico Hamilton - and to a degree - Charles Mingus were heading. There is a definite connection to Mingus since Waldron was on five of his albums during the 1950s.  That said, the arrangements are more in line with Chico Hamilton's musical direction, as evidenced by both a cello and flute.<br /><br />Waldron composed all of the tracks except the last one, so this album is also a snapshot of his own musical direction at this point in his career. The tracks are:<br /><br />Tension 6:37<br />Ollie's Caravan 8:39<br />The Cattin' Toddler 6:58<br />Portrait of a Young Mother 8:58<br />For Every Man There's a Woman 11:40<br />Total time is 43:52<br /><br />This album was recorded for Prestige at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on January 31, 1958. It features Art Farmer on trumpet with Eric Dixon on flute and Calo Scott on cello. The rhythm section is Waldron on piano, Julian Euell on bass and Elvin Jones on drums.

5.0,Tribute to Lady Day,"This is another of my favorite Waldron albums that were recorded in the late 1950s. This one is ostensibly a Lady Day tribute, which is fitting because Waldron was her pianist towards the end of her career, but there is only a single song that is associated with her.  That one is the title track that both she and Waldron wrote.<br /><br />You can listen to sound samples on the MP3 version of the album at [[ASIN:B000XVMF7C Mal Waldron Trio]]. While the short snippets will give you a good idea of the music, none fully capture each track (and especially the title track that features Jackie McLean on alto sax. Waldron composed or co-composed tracks 1, 2 and 4.<br /><br />This album was recorded for the Bethlehem label in NYC on February 24, 1959 with Maldron backed by Julian Euell on bass and Al Drears on drums. Some sources cite track 6 on which Waldron talks about Lady Day to the session, and others claim it was recorded later and included. Either way it is a few seconds over four minutes, which cuts into the music on the album, which clocks in at 38:11.",[],B0000057H9,B0000057H9,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-10-11 16:22:15.000,1,False,Silky Smooth Scarlet Cover
5.0,My personal favorite of the eight albums Quebec recorded as a leader,"Up front, I rarely listen to Quebec, but when I heard this album I had to get it. I love his tone, which reminds me a lot of Ben Webster.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples to get a hint of the music. It's definitely flavored with a heavy dose of R&B. I love the song selection, but even more I love the interplay between Quebec's tenor sax and Grant Green's guitar. It's like a glue that holds each track together. Quebec composed tracks 2 and 5, and Green composed track 4 - the remainder of the tracks are standards and some lesser known compositions. The arrangements, though, are excellent on every track.<br /><br />This album features Quebec and Green backed by Paul Chambers on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums on all tracks except Count Every Star, which features Sonny Clark on piano, Sam Jones on bass and Louis Hayes on drums. Note that the piano on all tracks except Count Every Star is Quebec, who was an excellent pianist as well as a saxophonist.<br /><br />The album was recorded for Blue Note at Rudy van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio on December 16 (all tracks except Count Every Star) and December 23, 1961.

The first seven tracks are the 1965 album [[ASIN:B00006ITS5 On Fire]], which is Kessel's first live, recorded night club performance. The remaining tracks are from various European performances.<br /><br />On the first seven tracks Kessel is backed by Jerry Scheff on bass and Frank Capp on drums. The group is super tight (and Capp's brushwork on some tracks is amazing.)  These tracks were recorded sometime during the summer of 1965 at PJ's in Los Angeles.<br /><br />Track 8 was recorded in Denmark in 1969. Kessel is backed by Larry Ridley on bass and Don Lamond on drums.<br /><br />There is some dispute about tracks 9 through 11. One source I checked cited Berlin. Another claims a Swedish TV broadcast. Both agree the year is 1973, but I was unable to pinpoint the date(s) or discover who the backing musicians are.<br /><br />Track 12 features a trinity of great guitarists with Kessel joined by Kenny Burrell and Grant Green on guitar.

5.0,"Unequaled, but the Vinyl is better than the CD","This is an underrated recording, and for obvious reasons.  Horowitz in this 1978 live recording, does not play all the notes. He is an old man, and he has terrific earlier recordings of the same piece.<br /><br />But this is a thrilling performance.  It is so captivating, and propels you into this astonishing ending, that at the end you will feel it has pulled all the breath out of you.  You can hear the audience in the hall react exactly the same way:  one huge collective gasp. Then, thunderous applause, shouting, ecstasy.<br /><br />All because what you get here may not be the most exacting Rachmaninoff, but it is a great PERFORMANCE.  And: LIVE.  Yes, I know about the splicing later and all that, and have been subjected to learned conversations by masterful critics about all its inadequacies.  And yes, I have and love almost all (and several other) of the great performances of the Rach 3 cited in other posts by commenters and several great ones not mentioned here.  And, I cannot figure out why anyone would try to say one of these is the best, or some other great performance should be disparaged because it is not the one loved ""most."" I suppose, to admit my bias, the Third is my favorite Rachmaninoff, although on some days the Paganini Rhapsody played by the composer is the one that grabs me.  But normally it is the Third -- certainly not as intellectual as the Rhapsody -- but there is so much passion in Horowitz' Third that no other version makes you feel so ALIVE.<br /><br />It is just that the thing that is special about this performance is it captures the essence, the meaning, of the piece better, and is as thrilling and literally captivating as this wonderful music can be.  It will leave you limp.<br /><br />I hope all of you can listen to the vinyl: [[ASIN:B003HU5046 Vladimir Horowitz New York Philharmonic Eugene Ormandy  Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3 Recorded Live At Carnegie Hall January 8, 1978  (with  concert program insert)]]  When the cd first came out (I already had two copies of the vinyl just to be safe), I bought the cd immediately and then, later, bought another I'd heard had been better remastered.  None of the criticisms about the sound of the strings, etc etc are valid with the vinyl.<br /><br />I am not one of those who claim that only vinyl is true hifi, but in this case the vinyl IS richer.  Why am I emphasizing this?  Because Horowitz, Ormandy and the NY Phil deserve the recognition for what they accomplished on January 8, 1978.<br /><br />Despite this praise of the vinyl, you should still get the cd is still because it captures much (if not all) the excitement of the live performance, and the thrill of a brilliant collective experience.",[],B000003FFK,B000003FFK,AGACDJYPMWRYV6K7HTVVH7Y4RMAQ,2013-11-04 21:38:46.000,4,False,365 Rare and Inspiring Quotations

The subsequent cd's turned into Natalie as the focus.  Now I know why.  Emily and Marty do not have lead vocal ability.  They do not have bad voices.  Unfortunately, they don't have voices that I enjoyed listening to. I kept thinking if the songs had been better written it would make up for the weak vocals.

The members of the quartet have changed since this Chandos recording, but this quartet has one of the longest continuing history in the 20th century. They pride themselves on maintaining a certain distinctive Borodin sound. A night of music in a foreign country is a very ephemeral fleeting feeling. I remembered that sound as remarkably intense, but effortless. Technically perfect, but emotional. The players played as &#34;one&#34;, and communicated onstage with each other well.

1.0,Disappointing.,"The day I heard Tristan as a live guest on the Bob Rivers radio show, I went out and got myself a copy of her CD.  She performed marvelously, live on the radio, her voice was unusual and full of passion for her music.  So, firstly... I got the CD home and discovered, of course, that it was copy protected AND that to back up my CD would require allowing the CD to install regulating software on my computer.  Who in their right mind would allow an unknown program to be installed onto their computer - a machine that most likely contains valuable data and trusted programs?  Not me.  Secondly, after listening to the CD on a old CD player, I discovered that the songs on the CD weren't remotely up to the standard I'd heard her perform live on the radio.  Gone was the passion and the unique quality of her voice, replaced by songs that pretty much all sound like everything else out there on mainstream radio.  I hope that her future CDs live up to the hopes I had for this one.  I won't purchase them, however, if they contain the sort of ""protection"" that makes this one practically useless.",[],B0009X759W,B0009X759W,AGHFPF3DOVIEKHL5PZO6DNNHBOLQ,2006-04-21 01:12:57.000,5,False,Process-oriented approach suitable as corp guide

5.0,Runk!,"When was the last time a punk band put out a double album?  Never!  The Sex Pistols entire output consisted of one album and four singles.  Ok, ok, I just wanted to say that; I know this isn't a genuine double album, more of a special packaging offer, but it waddles and quacks like a double, and so will be treated as such.  Sometimes double albums come out that just shouldn't have been.  They are actually bloated single albums in desperate need of editing.  That is not the case with Sunbathing Animal + Content Nausea.<br />The first album is the standard Parquet Courts lineup, and according to the cover information, so is Parkay Quarts, who are responsible for Content Nausea.  But according to Jenny Eliscu, Sean and Max are largely absent from the second album, and I will defer to her because she gets paid to know that stuff.<br />Let's talk about punk.<br />Punk is undead.  Of course its heyday was back in the late seventies and early eighties, you know, a bunch of dirty slamdancers who couldn't actually play their instruments.  However, it was a valid anti-establishment movement, as the establishment was lugging twenty thousand pounds of drum-kit up onstage and whacking out forty minute solos.  Punk was musical Dada-ism.<br />Who would you describe as punk today?  The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Parquet Courts certainly, but both are technically adept, so it is really a punk ethos that pervades their rock music.  Thus we could call it Runk! (rock-punk), or even Pindie! (punk-indie), my nomenclature certainly being no worse than various websites waffling on about a post-punk revival.  And for want of a better word, both the YYY's and Courts can turn out a mournful ballad, or a blistering punk diatribe.  Obviously there is one huge, glaring question left.  How to categorize the Violent Femmes?  They have been historically (and correctly) placed in the folk-punk category, which according to my system becomes Funk!, but apparently that cognomen is already being used, leading us to the logical alternative, Polk! (punk-folk).<br />Sunbathing Animal opens with Bodies Are Made Of (slugs and guts).  On the surface not an entirely profound lyric, but it is always worthwhile digging deeper.  ""Bodies are made of slugs & guts/Mister's suit was stained like a sweat-shop/I said, 'It's my soul I wanna keep it on the inside.'""<br />or the second verse:<br />""Bodies are made of sparks and dust/Slumped and prone to lore and lust.""<br />It's a great hook-and-riff opener that leads you into one of the first tracks getting airplay from the album: Black & White.  What is striking about B&W and several other songs is the sheer quantity of lyrics Mr. Savage can blow through in four minutes with that ska-punk shout-sing of his.  You will also pick up some horns, and later a harmonica, not exactly go-to instruments in a standard punk orchestration.<br />The wordiness of Sunbathing Animal reminds me of the notorious Roger Waters album that followed the dissolution of Pink Floyd, The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking, just absolutely unadulterated proof that too much navel gazing in college can be a bad thing.  But Parquet Courts can pull off wordiness with a pace and delivery that just flows right on by you.<br />Dear Ramona is a ballad, a mournful dirge well spaced and punkishly crooned.<br />There are four more tracks between here and the title track, Sunbathing Animal.  She's Rolling features the aforementioned harmonica, proof that this ain't 1978, and PC not just a bunch of punks.<br />Sunbathing Animal is another epic, wordy track.  Probably my favorite soon follows, Instant Disassembly.  A full four minutes transpire as the band knocks out two verses before the first chorus, creating the longest song on the album, and about seven minutes of post-punk revivalist bliss.<br />Ducking & Dodging is also wordy, but the speed-delivery cokes right thru it.<br />Sunbathing Animal went to #55 on the Billboard Albums chart, so maybe these guys will be able to pay their rent, probably the worst thing that can happen to any band, success.  Look at Cold Play, they went from kinda hip to fat, lazy, formulaic, and lamer than a Gwyneth Paltrow cookbook.<br /><br />Content Nausea is a different beast.  Twelve tracks, but the booklet contains lyrics for only seven; the balance consisting of four instrumentals and a controversial remake.  Nausea breezes by a tad quicker than its predecessor, about forty-some minutes in length, so you ain't gettin cheaped.<br />My only quibble would be the instrumentals.  They are too good.  Rather than just toe-tappin' filler, they could have been fleshed out and re-animated into fully-fledged songs.  However, it is what it is at this point.<br />Content Nausea doesn't present as many single opportunities as Sunbathing Animal, but it is a very solid and respectable piece of work.  There is some Twitter and Facebooking going on around These Boots, penned by Lee Hazlewood in 1966 for Nancy Sinatra (she was told to sing it like a 16-yr-old-girl who ***cks truck drivers.)<br />Now there are those who claim that Parquet Courts Jumped the Shark with this track.  You really had to be there back in '77 for that Happy Days episode.  It was a big deal, we were just kids, and 30 million people tuned in to watch the Fonz in swimsuit and leather jacket.  In hindsight, the phrase correctly sums up what happened at the conclusion of that three-part Happy Days episode, but I don't think it applies to PC.  The tone and pace of These Boots is perfect, the lyrics hit right, and the overall Parquet Courts sound is a great match for the song.<br />Ok, almost there.  The final track of a double album.  It just happens to be a total doggone monster.  The band buried their treasure deep, but having been released as a single it has garnered some airplay.  It is easily one of the best song of 2014, if not the entire twenty-teens.  Looking for a song to narrate a movement?  ""I Can't Breathe!"", or, ""Hands Up Don't Shoot!"", yep, here is a song worthy of a national movement.<br />Uncast Shadow of a Southern Myth opens replete with Civil War imagery:<br />""I'd seen the bloodlanes of Antietam/and the shotgun shack in Tupelo/But a brick circumference left hollow by Sherman,/crumbling before me, how it moaned!""<br />There is a gun in the opening scenes, and like a Russian play, that same gun reappears in the final act:<br />""Black male standing 'round six-foot-something.""<br />and the key verse:<br />'""That broken glass supports forced entry""/reminds his lawyer through the phone/""What Southern judge do you know,""/comforting gently/""Jails white men who defend their home?""'<br />All delivered as a gentle lyrical chiding until the final outtro-chorus that Mr. Savage really leans into with a good scream; ""He was the uncast shadow of a Southern myth...""",[],B00OJXARP2,B00OJXARP2,AGKHDQO3Q74QAOVEQEIZ3BMSDEBA,2015-01-08 00:58:22.000,3,True,Magical Essential Oil Combinations for Sensory Pleasure

WTF !??<br /><br />Rant over .... or is it ?....Nah let's bitch some more.....<br />That's why I dinged it 2 stars_ missing a whole star just for not including the track 'Stay' and another star for including a terrible version of a great song_ Yeah, sorry Mr Bowie....stay away from doing cover tracks !<br /><br />For the casual Bowie listener - He generally has 1-2 really good songs per album amidst a bunch of crap, honestly_ there are a few exceptions, like the album 'Lets Dance' & 'Low' where there are actually like 4-5 really great tracks_ So it's not very hard to come up with a compilation of the VERY BEST Bowie tracks....I mean, the 1-2 really great tracks per albulm will jump out at you like a can of peanut snakes (if you remember those from yesteryears) cuz the other tracks are so terrible_ But his really good tracks ARE REALLY GOOD tracks !<br />Considering Station to Station has only 2-3 good tracks, one of which is 'Stay' - which is the Best Tack by far - They are idiots for leaving it off !<br /><br />Oh yeah, and that track 'Boys Keep Swinging' SUCKS !<br />why would it even be on here !??<br /><br />If you are Bowie clueless then this is a good CD, but just know that this IS NOT ALL of his best stuff - and this includes some of his absolute worst stuff",[],B000BEPLUO,B000BEPLUO,AGKTPA4K3NKKVKX3RHSW7ZBLZEXA,2018-11-15 19:54:37.852,10,True,Understanding Your Man on a Deep Primal Level

4.0,"Not quite the Pixies, but pretty decent","I got this album because of the comparisons everyone seemed to be making to The Pixies. But rather than the slack-jawed awe I had the first time I heard the Pixies, the Shackletons gave me a nostalgic appreciation.  I was lucky enough to live through the hey day of the Minneapolis music scene and the band they reminded of most is Trip Shakespeare (predesecer of Semisonic.) They have quirky lyrics and good melodies, and doing stuff other people just aren't doing with their music.<br /><br />A big part of this nostalgia is because the sound is not overly polished.  It seems very much like the music I heard in the bars in my pre-parenthood days.

Being young, stupid, and busy, I then forgot about it. Just now I came across one of these songs on YouTube and it all came back to me. I can sing along with most of these melodies all these years later - they are really strong tunes. And the playing is creative and exciting.

5.0,Underrated!,"I know everyone says PM is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but I still think his work is underrated. I read an article in the NY Times on Sunday about the oncoming glut of posthumous Michael Jackson ""PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED!!!!!!!"" material; the piece made note of the generation of artists that MJ influenced. Then I found this recording [""Still Life""] on vinyl at a flea market for a dollar. I thought, hmmm... MJ was certainly a very specially gifted performer, plus he helped write songs that are up there with the all-time greatest American tunesmiths. But Metheny's work goes way beyond that. PM's recordings are pan-American, deep, and timeless. It's hard to imagine ""Last Train Home"" and ""Minuano"" *not* enduring like Concierto de Aranjuez or even the Bach Magnificat. I understand what some people say about PM and Lyle Mays being hung up on '70's progressive rock - I definitely hear the influence - but to me their collaboration is as sincere as it is ambitious, especially on this album. Every piece is the loudly-sing-along variety. It is an exceedingly rare, exquisite work of art. I used to consider the [admittedly goofy] ""We Live Here"" my favorite PMG opus, but after putting some more miles on my new, old $1 vinyl LP from the flea market, I think ""Still Life"" is the new title holder. If you haven't heard it in a while, it is well worth it to set aside some time and give it your full attention.",[],B000000OQD,B000000OQD,AGMHWXS6HWO5P76BVBJWFQORNNDQ,2010-12-14 22:21:00.000,0,False,Yet another wonderful Annie Hawes book

4.0,A.D.D. - A distinctive debut,"He's no Kelly Clarkson, but at least Blake Lewis has made his mark by co-writing twelve of the songs on this album.  The mix may best be described as eclectic, and you'll probably have to listen to the album a few times to get a feel for it, but I think you'll find a few tracks here to make this worth your while.<br /><br />Hint: This album sounds best through headphones with the volume turned up.<br /><br />The tracks that deserve a comment are:<br /><br />1. Break Anotha - A little techno, a little beat-boxing, a little funk, but all held together with a great beat.  A good choice for the first single.<br />2. Gots To Get Her - An updated tribute to ""Puttin' on the Ritz""<br />3. How Many Words - Nice melody and a comfortable vocal range for him<br />4. Surrender - The one he didn't co-write.  All around radio-friendly song with an eighties feel.<br />5. Without You -Arguably one of the best songs on the album, if you like eighties ballads, that is.<br />6. End of the World - A mid-tempo track suited to his vocal range, with a swelling chorus. This would make a good single<br />7. 1000 Miles - Nothing to do with the Vanessa Carlton song, and won't be as big a hit, but well worth a listen anyway<br />8. I Got U - Another mid-tempo track to end the album.  Sounds boy-band-ish.<br /><br />The song titles may make an English teacher faint, but you can't accuse Blake Lewis of not being himself on this album.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 22, 2007",[],B000WEDAGK,B000WEDAGK,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2007-12-22 18:40:14.000,19,False,Interesting - but not gripping!
5.0,Enchanting,"The third time's definitely a charm for singer/song-writer Vanessa Carlton, who grants three wishes for the listener with her latest album.<br /><br />1. Intelligent songwriting<br />2. Well produced songs<br />3. Non-mainstream fare<br /><br />The only thing I can find fault with is the length of the album.  Like the Cinderella fairytale, Carlton also stops just short of twelve with this eleven song offering, and doesn't even leave a glass slipper to tide us over until the next performance.<br /><br />Songs with magic in them:<br /><br />1. Nolita Fairytale - First single, recounting her life and times living in the Nolita district in Manhattan<br />2. Hands On Me - Second single. Mid-tempo track with catchy melody<br />3. Spring Street - nice ""na-na's""<br />4. Come Undone - best lyrics<br />5. The One - just because it features Stevie Nicks<br />6. Heroes & Thieves - single worthy title track<br />7. Home - just because it's such a personal and deeply reflective song<br /><br />Not that the rest are bad, but they're merely as good as we expect a Vanessa Carlton song to be.

3.0,Lost in translation?,"Shaggy returns to dancehall for this album, and although the rhythms are infectious and the lyrics typically risqué and funny, it may be difficult for non-West Indian listeners to understand his Jamaican creolese.<br /><br />Here's a guide to the tracks:<br /><br />1. Can't Hold Me: Serious song about being true to yourself, your friends and your beliefs, as well as establishing and defending your boundaries and standing up for your rights.<br /><br />2. Bonafide Girl:  Third single with Rik Rok and Tony Gold about fidelity.  Personal favorite.<br /><br />3. Intoxication: Title track and possible single. Naughty song about the after effects of too much alcohol, his woman's best friend and some whips and restraints<br /><br />4. Those Days: Interesting sample of ""Those Were the Days, My Friend"" by Mary Hopkins.  This track features Na'sha.<br /><br />5. More Woman: Naughty song about infidelity<br /><br />6. Woman Scorn: Funny song about getting caught cheating and trying to wriggle out of it.<br /><br />7. Mad Mad World: Song featuring Sizzla Kalonji and Collie Budz.  A commentary on the state of the world - crime, false prophets, white collar crime, nuclear weapons, welfare, Medicare, ethnic cleansing, politics and ""polytricks"".<br /><br />8. Out of Control: Features Rayvon.  Naughty song about getting lucky<br /><br />9. Church Heathen: First single, and tongue in cheek commentary about one-day Christians, who appear pious and god-fearing on Sundays, but misbehave for the rest of the week.<br /><br />10. Wear Di Crown: Typical Shaggy song featuring Mischieve about high maintenance beauty pageant contestants<br /><br />11. Criteria: Mr. Loverman states his requirements in women<br /><br />12.

4.0,Sparks smolders,"... and by ""smolders"" I mean that she glows and is smokin' hot, but thanks to some damp material she falls just short of igniting the fiery album I was expecting.<br /><br />Pretty, bubbly, young, a great performer and with an amazing voice, Jordin Sparks nails some winners in this album, which already has three hits under its belt:<br /><br />1. This is My Now - the song she sang to take the American Idol title from Blake Lewis (Granted, he was at a disadvantage due to not being able to change up the song to better suit his style)<br />2. Tattoo - Definitely mainstream pop, a catchy song geared towards radio and television saturation.  (I still like it)  Co-written by Sparks.<br />3. No Air - Hot, hot song with hottie Chris Brown (need I say more?)<br /><br />Other songs to look out for:<br /><br />One Step at a Time - An upbeat, funky song, well suited to her voice<br /><br />Now You Tell Me - An ideal pop song for an Idol graduate<br /><br />Next to You - Mid tempo song carried by the chorus<br /><br />Just For the Record - Another mainstream pop song<br /><br />Not that hot:<br /><br />""Freeze"" - Self-explanatory. She sings well, but it's not a really good song. Co-written by Sparks<br /><br />""Shy Boy"", ""See My Side"", ""God Loves Ugly"" - Monotonous<br /><br />""Permanent Monday"", ""Young and In Love"" -Unmemorable<br /><br />This debut album proves that Sparks has the voice to soar to greater heights, but she needs some edgier material to push her above the rest of the mainstream crowd.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, March 20, 2008",[],B000WQ9U9Y,B000WQ9U9Y,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-03-20 13:33:38.000,11,False,Wrap yourself in a blanket for this chilly thriller!

Bedingfield heads off for the Caribbean with a few reggae-influenced tracks on her second US album, which is packed with music for easy listening on lazy sunny days.<br /><br />Very different from her first album, this one is a little slicker in the production, and the lyrics more formulaic, but the feel-good aspect shines through in every track.  A few more upbeat tracks wouldn't have hurt, but when she goes mellow, she sounds like Corinne Bailey Rae.<br /><br />The hit of the album is ""Love Like This"" featuring Sean Kingston, an infectious reggae/hip hop track, but you should also try:<br /><br />""Put Your Arms Around Me"" - a sweet sing-a-long and sway number<br />""Pocketful of Sunshine"" - a little faster track with an electro-pop beat<br />""Piece of Your Heart"" - nice piano intro to a jazzy track<br />""Soulmate"" - a slow pop ballad about finding that special someone<br />""Say it Again"" featuring Adam Levine (Maroon 5) - pop song with a pleasant melody that reminds me of ""Unwritten""<br />""Angel"" - all together now, ""A-N-G-E-L""<br />""Freckles"" - sounds a bit like Katie Melua<br /><br />The momentum peters out in the last few tracks, but you can try the above-mentioned songs from this pocket-sized burst of sunshine for an early taste of summer.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, March 24, 2008",[],B000Y14U4M,B000Y14U4M,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-03-24 15:26:32.000,20,False,"""Thumbs up"" from my granddaughter!"
4.0,Back to the eighties,"After a four year absence, the pop icon from Australia is back with a disco-electronic-pop album that will send you right back to those wild partying days of the eighties. If you're a young `un, ask your parents about it. (They may not remember too much about that decadent decade, but they WILL remember the music)<br /><br />First single ""2 Hearts"" is a rework of a song by the British group Kish Mauve, who also produced the single.  This track takes you back to your sweater-off-the-shoulder/leg-warmer Flashdance days.  Don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />Strictly for dancing:<br /><br />""Like a Drug"" - starts like ""You Really Got Me"" (originally by The Kinks), which is on the soundtrack for the movie ""Doogal"", songs from which were performed by Kylie.<br /><br />""In My Arms"" - single-worthy, radio-friendly track sounding like early Madonna.  Think ""Holiday"" and ""Borderline""<br /><br />""Heart Beat Rock"" - more early Madonna<br /><br />""The One"" - another remake, another single, and one of the best tracks on the album<br /><br />""Wow"" - name says it all<br /><br />For tapping your toes and shaking your hair:<br /><br />""Speakerphone"" - electronic pop, sort of like Daft Punk's ""One More Time""<br /><br />""Sensitized"" - typical `80s track, nothing special<br /><br />""No More Rain"" - familiar sounding track that I can't place right now (maybe slower Madonna).  I really like this one too.<br /><br />Mellow stuff:<br /><br />""All I See"" - pop/R&B track, sounds like a Janet Jackson song<br /><br />""Stars"" - a little like Simply Red I think<br /><br />Not so hot:<br /><br />""Nu-di-ty"" - electronic pop filler track<br /><br />""Cosmic"" - sleepy filler track<br /><br />Recommended for Madonna fans, and anybody old enough to remember and enjoy the music of the eighties.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, March 24, 2008",[],B000XFZT1M,B000XFZT1M,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-03-25 01:18:45.000,9,False,Just a darn good read!

4.0,How's your Hebrew?,"Like many people, I got this album because of the MacBook Air laptop ad featuring the track ""New Soul"", which is already released as a single.  Yael Naim is a French artiste now living in Israel, and the tracks are in Hebrew, French and English.<br /><br />She has a distinctive singing voice, and specializes in sultry jazzy numbers, sometimes with a folksy lilt.  The song of the album is of course ""New Soul"", and there's an unusual, unexpected and very strange interpretation of ""Toxic"", originally sung by Britney Spears.<br /><br />Other tracks to note are:<br /><br />""Paris"" - sung in Hebrew and French, which translated is an ode to her favorite city.<br /><br />""Too Long"" - a plaintive song in English where she sings ""I waited for so long / Outside myself / You see I was pretending / To be someone else""<br /><br />""Shelcha"" - a slow Enya-type song in Hebrew and English<br /><br />""Lonely"" - a minimalistic, simple, melancholy song in English, definitely NOT a karaoke song<br /><br />""Far Far"" - another single, in English, that goes ""How can you stay outside? / There's a beautiful mess inside""<br /><br />""Lachlom"" - a dreamy song in Hebrew<br /><br />""Pachad"" - jazzy piano intro leading into Hebrew lyrics<br /><br />A great easy-listening album for when you're in the mood for something new and a little different.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, March 26, 2008",[],B0013LP86Q,B0013LP86Q,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-03-27 03:46:26.000,62,False,Hoping this is not Grant's enduring style!
4.0,Firing on both octaves,"Ashlee Simpson's third album is a collection of pop/dance tracks sleekly produced by the ""popular guys"" like Timbaland and Chad Hugo.  To her credit, Simpson co-wrote all the songs on the album, and barring any lip-syncing accidents, it should do just fine.<br /><br />Not the strongest of vocalists, Simpson relies on dance beats and catchy choruses, a prime example being first single ""Outta My Head (Ay Ya Ya)"" which has both.  A better song that's a little more Avril Lavigne pop/rock-y is the second single ""Little Miss Obsessive"", which is about a break-up for which reconciliation isn't quite out of the question.<br /><br />""Boys"" is a funny upbeat track, while ""Rule Breaker"" sounds like something intended for Gwen Stefani, as does ""Ragdoll"".  ""Hot Stuff"" is another funny dance track, and you won't be able to resist the disco beat. ""Murder"" has an interesting Eastern vibe which partially makes up for lyrics. The album ends with the simple and unimpressive ballad ""Never Dream Alone"", but the weakest track in every way is the title track, sorry to say.<br /><br />Completely and thoroughly mainstream pop, get this one just for the fun of it.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, May 3, 2008",[],B000Y9OOV8,B000Y9OOV8,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-05-04 04:26:21.000,14,False,Summer in the Cotswalds....
4.0,"Good, but ""over-balladed""","This is a strong debut album from X-Factor winner Leona Lewis, the only potential problems being a surfeit of ballads, and a large dose of overexposure.  The British born singer/songwriter is of Guyanese/Welsh parentage, and was no stranger to performing before catching the eye of Simon Cowell, who moved heaven, earth and Clive Davis to ensure that this album had all the backing it needed.<br /><br />Even before the album was released, she already had a hit single with her version of the Kelly Clarkson song ""A Moment Like This"", which can be found as a bonus on the UK version of the album.  Please note that the track listing for the UK Version is different to the US and Canadian releases. The songs ""Forgive Me"" (produced by Akon) and ""Misses Glass"" on this version take the place of ""Homeless"" (a slow R&B ballad) and ""The Best You Never Had"" (a slightly faster ballad).<br /><br />Songs of interest are ""Bleeding Love"", the first single from the album; ""Better in Time"", the second single (pop/R&B) which reminds me of Alicia Keys ""No One""; ""I Will Be"", a cover of the Avril Lavigne song; ""Yesterday"", a pop/R&B track where she sounds like Mariah Carey; ""Take A Bow"", a radio-friendly R&B track; and ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"", a cover of the Roberta Flack  hit written by Ewan MacColl.  Lewis also co-wrote the songs ""Whatever It Takes"", a mid-tempo R&B track, and ""Here I Am"", a pop ballad.<br /><br />Special mention should be made of the powerful and emotional ballad ""Footprints in the Sand"" inspired by the famous poem by Mary Stevenson, which ends:<br /><br />The Lord replied<br />""The times when you have seen only one set of footprints in the sand,<br />Is when I carried you.""<br /><br />Undoubtedly talented, strikingly photogenic, and with a lovely voice, it seems a bit early for all the comparisons to Mariah Carey and early Whitney Houston, but I do believe that we'll be hearing a lot more from Leona Lewis.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, May 8, 2008",[],B0012TBGYC,B0012TBGYC,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-05-08 19:57:35.000,36,False,"Yes, a plausible, captivating thriller!"

Fast forward to 2008 to his second studio album, and although he's a lot more popular now, this is probably the best album you've heard only one song from.<br /><br />That song is ""In Love with a Girl"", the first single, but by no means the only good track on the album.  DeGraw's easy-listening melodies and simple arrangements make for timeless songs that will still be current in years to come.<br /><br />This very talented young man writes his own songs, and also plays piano and guitar, and I strongly encourage you to check out the following songs.<br /><br />Next to You (Wait a Minute Sister)<br />Cheated on me<br />Young Love<br />She Holds a Key<br />Untamed<br />Let it Go<br /><br />Not that the other tracks aren't extremely good, but these are the ones that stand out, and the ones I think are single-worthy.

He's also done his share of touring and volunteer work, while still finding time to record this, his fourth full length studio album.<br /><br />The album comprises 12 tracks of radio-friendly pop ballads of varying tempos, the strong points being the clarity and purity of his voice, and the inspiring and emotional lyrics.  The first single, which is also the title track, was co-written by Ryan Tedder (OneRepublic) and was the inspiration for the album.<br /><br />""Where I Draw the Line"" is another track that should be a single, and it's about not wanting to surrender your heart for fear of getting hurt.<br /><br />""Seems whenever I let somebody get this close<br />I'm right back where I got hurt the most<br />And that's why, oh that's why<br />Around my heart is where I draw the line""<br /><br />""Grace of God"" reflects on being grateful for the blessings in your life, empathizing with the many people who may be in need or in trouble.<br /><br />Other notable tracks are ""Ashes""; ""Everything I Don't Need"" (where he throws in an R&B vibe); ""Weight of the World"" (great chorus) and ""Lover All Alone"" (co-written by Aiken)<br /><br />The only thing wrong with this album is that it's only 12 songs long.<br />(I don't really like the cover art either, but that's neither here nor there)<br /><br />Recommended for American Idol and pop music fans.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, May 27, 2008",[],B00130973W,B00130973W,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-05-28 00:47:49.000,21,False,My head is spinning!

If I had to pick my top five, I'd choose the two I've mentioned before, plus ""Sand on My Feet"", which reminds me of ""Breakfast at Tiffanys"" by Deep Blue Something; the jazzy Latin ""Driving Down Brazil"" and the disco track ""I'm a Fire"".<br /><br />As she herself states proudly on track four, the Queen is back!<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 2, 2008",[],B0016B6ZKG,B0016B6ZKG,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-06-03 00:58:40.000,33,False,"Sad, funny, interesting - a great, too short read!"
4.0,Doubling entendres with the voicings,"Back in May 2006 I reviewed the album [[ASIN:B000EGEJWK Yes, Virginia...]] by the Dresden Dolls, and I quote myself (after all, nobody else is going to quote me):<br /><br /> ""You'll need to keep an open mind for this one, but The Dresden Dolls are the most excitingly different duo that I've come across in ages.""<br /><br />Fast forward to 2008 and here's ""No, Virginia..."" which isn't technically a new album, because it's made up of left-over tracks from previous albums and B-sides, but it's definitely good enough to qualify for ""new"" status.<br /><br />Amanda Palmer is as brilliant as ever with her dark, edgy lyrics, pounding piano and impossible-to karaoke vocal performances.  This type of music (punk cabaret) may be an acquired taste, but for originality and audacity it can't be beaten.<br /><br />The songs that I have been playing from this album are:<br /><br />""Dear Jenny""- listen for the howling at the end<br /><br />""Night Reconnaissance"", where she observes ""Nothing is crueler than children who come from good homes""<br /><br />""Lonesome Organist R@pes Page-Turner"" - not only a naughty name, but witty lyrics such as ""So on the bench I watched his left hand crossing / While doubling entendres with the voicings""<br /><br />""Sorry Bunch"" - great piano performance<br /><br />""Pretty in Pink"" - my favorite track.  Begins like Dire Straits ""Walk of Life"", and just gets better<br /><br />""The Kill"" - love the lyrics<br /><br />""The Sheep Song"" - a punk cabaret lullaby<br /><br />If you know somebody whose musical taste is off-mainstream, you might want to put this on your Christmas list to convince them that Santa Claus is alive and cabaretting.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 6, 2008",[],B0015435PW,B0015435PW,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-06-07 04:14:24.000,20,False,Man's inhumanity to man...whew!
5.0,Girl just having fun,"Madonna did it<br />Kylie did it<br />Donna did it<br />Now heeeeeere's Cyndi<br /><br />Dance music is hot again, mostly because of the ladies listed above, and certainly good news for those of us who spent the `80s on the dance floor.<br /><br />This is the tenth studio album from the effervescent singer/songwriter who just wants to have fun, and is best enjoyed at full volume with the bass turned up, the way it was meant to be played.<br /><br />The first US single is ""Same Ol' Story"", the track that put the [EXPLICIT LYRICS] warning on the album, but this isn't the best song in my opinion.  I like ""Set Your Heart"" which was released as a single in Japan, beginning like the Bee Gees' ""More Than a Woman"", and then blending into an `80s R&B dance track perfectly suited to her vocals.<br /><br />The next single is ""Into the Nightlife"", another instant favorite with a booming intro that will have your moneymaker shakin'.  Also terrific are ""Rocking Chair""; the addictive ""Echo"" that you'll want to hear again and again and ""Grab a Hold"" which is vintage Lauper.<br /><br />To mix it up a little she includes the mid-tempo ""Rain on Me"" and ""Lyfe"", the latter being a little different from anything else on the album, in that the tempo is different, and it's a bit funky (an explicit word here too).  ""Rain on Me"" is very strong lyrically, and a possible single.<br /><br />""I am a robber in the dark<br />Singing about a broken heart<br />Answering whistles in the air<br />Waiting for someone else to care<br /><br />But you can rain on me<br />Yea you can rain on me....""<br /><br />There's absolutely no filler material on this totally fun album, which is recommended for anyone who can take it to the brink.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 10, 2008",[],B001725ZB4,B001725ZB4,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-06-11 02:06:30.000,20,False,An unforgettable read...
5.0,Country-folk for country folk,"Popular folk singer/songwriter Jewel tries something old for her new album, and comes up country fresh and honey sweet.  The tracks are like Carrie Underwood channeling The Carpenters for a perfect blend of vintage country with pop and folk.<br /><br />The lead single is ""Stronger Woman"", an anthem for women everywhere who are being taken for granted by the men in their lives.  Her advice?<br /><br />""I'm gonna love myself more than anyone else<br />Believe in me, even if someone can't see<br />A stronger woman in me""<br /><br />She follows up with ""I Do"", which is a song about making a commitment to the person you love.  I really like the clever lyrics, and chorus, ""'Cause love is a game until it's played / And if it's lost, it can't ever be saved.""<br /><br />For some old-fashioned country violins and stuff, try ""Love is a Garden"" (a track with a little Shania Twain edge); ""Anyone But You""; ""Thump Thump"" ; ""'Til it Feels Like Cheating"" (pure country); ""Everything Reminds Me of You""; ""Love By You (Cowboy Waltz)"" (a bit of yodeling here) and ""Perfectly Clear""<br /><br />My son likes ""Rosey and Mick"", which has a chorus that reminds me of The Carpenters, and I also like ""Two Become One"" which is very familiar, but I can't recall the song it reminds me of right now.  (Maybe ""Islands in the Stream"" by Kenny and Dolly, combined with ""Love Doesn't Ask Why"" by Celine Dion)<br /><br />I prefer Jewel as a folk singer, but I appreciate her experimenting with a variety of styles.

4.0,"Simon Says: ""Sing""","If you watched American Idol, Season 7, you'll be familiar with Kristy Lee Cook, who finished in the Top 10 at number seven.  In 2005, prior to her Idol days, she released this debut album under the name Kristy Lee, comprising ten relatively short songs, three of which are covers of classic songs.<br /><br />Of the covers, she sings a straight-up version of Tammy Wynette's country staple ""Stand By Your Man"", and as she smoothly potters around that famous song ""Unchained Melody"", you'll recall how many times you watched that Patrick Swayze/Demi Moore scene from ""Ghost"".  The third cover is a pitch perfect copy of LeAnn Rimes' ""Blue"".<br /><br />The other tracks are standard country songs, ""Good Luck"", ""Hold Your Horses"" and ""Clean Break"" being the better songs, while ""Put Your Heart Into It"" sounds like a combination of Shania Twain's ""If You Wanna Touch Her, Ask!"" and Collin Raye's ""That's My Story"".  I liked the faster tracks because when she increases the tempo she sounds like she's truly enjoying herself.<br /><br />My one criticism is that she needs to define and claim her own unique sound and style, as this album proves her more of a musical chameleon, particularly on the covers, which although good, aren't ""her own"" (to quote Randy Jackson, the man of a half-dozen catch phrases.)<br /><br />She's not only a talented country music singer, but also a model, actress (commercials) and yes, even horse trainer, and it will be interesting to see her parlay the training and experience from AI7 into a career in the entertainment industry.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 16, 2008",[],B000CAKUAS,B000CAKUAS,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-06-16 19:52:35.000,6,False,Brilliant - an unforgettable novel.
4.0,Counting down to re-launch,"This is a CD that grows on you, and with every listen you feel a little more comfortable with it.  This young singer/songwriter sounds like she has an old soul, and you can easily see why she has been compared with Carly Simon and Carole King.<br /><br />The song that stood out from the beginning was her cover of the Aerosmith 1973 hit ""Dream On"".  Brooke interprets the piano power ballad in her own way, and by the time she gets to the chorus you're right there singing along with her.  Another extremely good cover is her version of Coldplay's ""Yellow"", the second single from their album ""Parachutes"".<br /><br />Of the other songs, my favorite is ""Keep Running"", but others to try are ""Free"", ""The Way Things Used to Be"", ""Change"" and ""Come to my Rescue"".<br /><br />I've listened to some of the early works of the other American Idol Season 7 finalists, and I think this album is the best of the lot.

(Mind you, I still like Crazy Frog - Bam! Bam!)<br /><br />Hudgens may not be the best singer around, but the arrangements and great song choices make up for this, and her fresh faced good looks don't hurt either.  The good songs (even for elderly folk above 25) include first single ""Sneakernight"" a three minute dance track; first track ""Last Night""; the title track; ""First Bad Habit""; ""Hook It Up"" (a Gwen Stefani-type track); ""Amazed""; ""Don't Leave"" and ""Did It Ever Cross Your Mind"" (mid tempo).<br /><br />The dance tracks definitely dominate the album, which is a solid follow up to her 2006 debut album ""V"".

The twelve songs (plus a bonus track) will be particularly meaningful to women, and especially mothers everywhere, and touches on real issues that affect us all.<br /><br />The album starts with the jazzy title track, and then slows the pace down for the inspiring ""Lord Only Knows"", where she sings ""No matter what you or I do / No matter how we come unglued / Spring will come and we will be renewed"".  This is followed by ""Tell Me"" with its beautiful and simple melody, and then comes the rousing ""We Build This House"" with a gospel choir.<br /><br />Next comes every busy mother's story in ""The Little Things""; the positive outlook of ""You're the Shepherd""; the appreciation of everyday miracles in ""Hymn of Thanks"", and my personal favorite ""Hold On"".<br /><br />Closing off the album are ""This is my Dream""; the plaintive ""Take This Burden""; ""This Son of Mine""; ""Here I Am"" (great piano work) and the bonus track ""Pray for Peace"", an ensemble piece with the choir.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who embraces the Christian faith and enjoys the great music that comes with the package.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 20, 2008",[],B000MGTOUY,B000MGTOUY,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-07-21 00:58:37.000,18,False,Beautiful pictures and good story!

The new tracks are ""Christmas Without Carol"", which he co-wrote, and the suggestive ""Back Door Santa"", written by Clarence Carter back in the 60's.<br /><br />I'm not too sure that the latter belongs on the same album as ""Jingle Bells"" and ""Little Drummer Boy"", and I just don't get the warm and fuzzy Christmas feeling when I hear:<br />""I make all the little girls happy, while the boys are out to play<br />I ain't like the old Saint Nick, he don't come but once a year""<br /><br />Anyway, if you don't have the previous album, and you're a fan of funky, R&B Christmas music, this may be a good album for your collection.  Yamin is obviously comfortable with bluesy rhythms, and he has the voice to carry it off.

3.0,"""Yoko Romo"" fumbles","By going back to her roots, singer/songwriter Simpson proves that when it comes to country music she's a better songwriter than singer, but not by much. Eight of the tracks bear the Simpson name under writing credits, and although there are a few good songs, this won't go down as one of her better albums.<br /><br />The first single is ""Come on Over"" (co-written by Simpson), a short (less than 3 minutes) country-pop mainstream ""driving-along-on-a-Sunday-with-the-radio-on"" song, with a decent chorus and all the country trimmings.<br /><br />The second single is ""Remember That"", another country-pop song about an abusive relationship where the guy comes begging back after he comes to his senses.  The lyrics remind the victim of the physical and verbal abuse she's been through, and advises her to move on and survive.  This track has a catchy chorus, but just around this point you realize that Simpson is having a hard time with the high notes.<br /><br />The rest of the album includes a gospel-country track with a positive message; a couple of maudlin and drippy numbers; and a slew of generic slow country songs, where it becomes more and more obvious that the vocals aren't quite up to the challenge.<br /><br />""Still Beautiful"" is another track with a catchy chorus and positive message, but unfortunately it's simply not that memorable, and although it's good enough to be a single, you won't remember it in a few months.  The big finale with Dolly Parton is, sadly, Simpson's worst vocal performance on the album.<br /><br />She gets a passing grade on the writing, but gets an ""improvement required"" on the vocals.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 16, 2008",[],B001CO42BQ,B001CO42BQ,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-10-17 01:19:21.000,8,False,Good reading for career planning.
4.0,Wider coverage please,"This album of covers is mostly for people who are familiar with music from the `50s and `60s, and probably won't win JT any new fans.  He's always been able to mellow out a tune and put his own distinctive spin on it, but a couple of the tracks on this album are TOO mellow, some to the point of being almost unrecognizable, especially if you know the popular versions of the songs.<br /><br />The songs that make the album worthwhile for me are ""Wichita Lineman"" (Glenn Campbell, 1968) and ""Seminole Wind"" (John Anderson).  Others are ""It's Growing"" (The Temptations, 1965); ""Why Baby Why"" (George Jones, 1955); ""Some Days You Gotta Dance"" (Keith Urban) and ""On Broadway"" (The Drifters' 1963 hit)<br /><br />On the other hand, give me Neil Diamond's version of ""Suzanne"" any day, and as for ""Hound Dog"" - nuff said - Elvis rules!<br /><br />Stronger on the country tunes and average on the R&B, this album has its highs and lows. It's probably a good choice as background music for social gatherings and peaceful nights at home with a good book, but the song choices and arrangements add up to nothing special or particularly memorable.<br /><br />Listen to the samples and buy only the songs you like.<br /><br />Rated: 3.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 17, 2008",[],B001D5DQCU,B001D5DQCU,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-10-17 15:46:23.000,5,False,A keeper!
5.0,"""One of the millions of tiny moments, strung together to make a life""","Fans of contemporary Christian music will enjoy this second album from talented singer/songwriter/musician Laura Hall.  Following up on her 2006 album [[ASIN:B000MGTOUY A Woman of Faith]], Hall mixes it up a little this time to include some twanging country guitar music, courtesy of Linda Taylor (also from Whose Line Is It Anyway), a beautiful children's song with lead vocals from daughter Ruthie, and a talented cast of singers and musicians.<br /><br />The album begins with the title track, which reminds the listener to have faith that all things will happen by the grace of God, and in his good time.  The second track ""A Little Bit of Heaven"" raises the tempo with a rousing drum intro, and encourages love, dignity and respect of our sisters and brothers. A pedal steel guitar turns ""You Can Choose Hope"" into a country ballad, and then Katie McFadden and Kelly Macloed join in for ""Awake"" which is a short song emphasizing harmony over instruments.<br /><br />Next comes ""When We Worship You"", an R&B groove that reminds me of Bill Withers' ""Just the Two of Us"", and ""You Are"" (featuring Matt Phairas) which is a more traditional Christian song with beautiful lyrics:<br /><br />""You walk in heaven, we walk here on the earth<br />We walk here on the earth, You walk here with us""<br /><br />Things get jazzy with ""Love Believes"", and then back to country with ""God Never Promised"", and the humorous ""Why Won't You Do it My Way?""  The next track is one I really like, and features Hall's daughter Ruthie innocently singing ""What's God Like?""  This is a track that will appeal to kids everywhere.  Two more songs round out the album, ""Bigger Than Me"" (a funky pop groove) and ""The Moment"" (a rock ballad)<br /><br />All the songs are originals, with heartfelt and inspirational lyrics for modern times, and the backing music and vocals will make every day feel like a day of Worship.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 21, 2008",[],B001CINK7Y,B001CINK7Y,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-10-21 17:26:09.000,1,False,Disappointing...

The track list points the way to a very personal album which explores the time-honored country theme of broken hearts.<br /><br />The songs to watch are ""Best Days of Your Life"", ""Rocks Instead of Rice"", ""Makin' Me Fall in Love Again"", ""Don't You Know You're Beautiful"" and ""Lucky Girl"".  This album also firmly establishes Pickler as a songwriter, especially on the humorous songs, and she is credited on five of the ten tracks.<br /><br />First single ""Don't You Know You're Beautiful"" is a song with a positive message, advising women to accept themselves for who they are, instead of comparing themselves to others and putting themselves down.  Then comes ""I'm Your Woman"", a personal shout-out by a confident woman, and a nice upbeat song.<br /><br />""Didn't You Know How Much I Loved You"" is a classic break-up song with plenty of hurtin' (re-recorded version from Small Town Girl), and ""Lucky Girl"" expands on the same theme.<br /><br />""Did you tell her she's your second choice<br />'cause I wouldn't be your little toy""<br /><br />""One Last Time"" is a slow ballad which starts off like ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"", and once again, it's about breaking up, and then comes the upbeat ""Best Days of Your Life"" (co-written by Pickler and Taylor Swift), which is about ..... you guessed it!<br /><br />""Somebody to Love Me"" deals with loneliness, and then unexpectedly the mood changes with the bouncy ""Makin' Me Fall in Love Again"" about a new beginning.  The album closes with a humorous ode to a shop-a-holic in ""Going Out in Style"" where she sings:<br /><br />""Don't be sad or broken hearted<br />Spread my ashes in the shoe department""<br /><br />Recommended for any American Idol or Country Music Fan on your list.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 22, 2008",[],B001E2PTKY,B001E2PTKY,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,2008-10-22 14:26:34.000,8,False,A great book to read together!
4.0,Comfort zone,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. If I Were A Boy: First rate song, and gets better after you've watched the excellent video. Starts slowly and works its way into your heart.<br />2. Halo: Best song on the album. Passed up by Leona Lewis, who would also have done a pretty good job. Heart-pounding soaring chorus.<br />3. Ave Maria: Simple interpretation and beautifully sung version<br />4. Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It): Yes, even after all those parodies on youtube.<br />5. Diva: Didn't like this at first listen, and still don't care that much for the lyrics, but the track has grown on me.<br /><br />This is a 2 disc set, one disc of eight radio-friendly ballads, and one of eight R&B/Dance tracks. Other than the hits listed above, the first disc has ""Disappear"" which is a mainstream ballad, but didn't make the short list because she's a little shaky on the low notes.  ""Broken-Hearted Girl"" is a good ballad, but not an immediate stand-out, even though it's much, much better than the average filler material.  Nothing else is of the quality of (1.) (2.) or (3.) above.<br /><br />On disc two, ""Radio"" isn't a bad dance track, sounding a little disco Donna Summer-ish.  Same goes for ""Sweet Dreams"", a definite toe-tapper. ""Video Phone"" goes reggae and ""Hello"" is probably the weakest track on the album.  Didn't care for ""Ego"" or ""Scared of Lonely"" either, but they're not THAT bad.<br /><br />The most noticeable thing about this album is that Beyonce seems comfortable and confident with the songs, and you don't get the impression that she's straining or trying too hard.

After all the bad press (and behavior) of the last year, it must be gratifying to shape up and release a chart topping album and a series of hit singles.<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Womanizer: If you don't know this track you're probably dead. Better check to make sure.  I have this on my cell phone.  The video is also pretty good.<br />2. Circus: Infectious dance track - ""there's only two types of people in the world / the ones that entertain / and the ones that observe"".  Definitely an entertainer.<br />3. Out From Under: Radio-friendly ballad, well suited to her husky tones.<br />4. Shattered Glass: Seventies sounding dance track, and will get you bouncing, even though she pronounces it ""glay-ass""<br />5. If U Seek Amy: Third single, typical Britney, and a sure hit.<br />6. Lace and Leather: ""Watch me apply the pressure / All decked in lace and leather"" - nuff said.<br />7.

Yet ""It Was Written"" was an equally impressive album for the time it was released.  To me, this is ALMOST as much a classic as Illmatic was.<br /><br />Starting with ""The Message"", this album is a journey into the mind of one of the most prolific lyricists hip hop has ever known.<br /><br />""Street Dreams"" samples the same song sampled for countless hip hop tracks (most notably 2Pac for All Eyez On Me). No other has done it so well.<br /><br />""I Gave You Power"" is a DJ Premier track. Classic Primo. An extremely catchy loop used to classic Primo drumwork. Nas tells the story of a gun (from the gun's vantage point), which is an interesting and creative concept that makes for a dope track.<br /><br />""Affirmative Action"", with the original Firm ensemble (with Cormega), is the world's official introduction to the Firm (then Nas, AZ, Foxy and Cormega - which became Nas, AZ, Foxy and Nature). This is a great track from beginning to end, with no weak point. Tight beat, great opening from AZ to Mega Montana straight through to the extended finish by Foxy Brown.<br /><br />""Take It In Blood"", ""Shootouts"", ""If I Ruled The World"" and ""Silent Murder"" (Bonus Track) were all notable additions to the album.<br /><br />As far as hip hop albums go, this is almost as good as it gets.

4.0,"OK, so it's no ""Connected""...","Upon first listen, anyone who loved ""Connected"", which I know many of us did, had to be a bit shocked by the stark difference in style of the album.  It took me a few listens to get over this mental hurdle, but once over it, you find that this is a masterpiece of a different sort.  The soundscapes that Nicolay creates on this album flow together, just as they did on Connected.  This time the feeling is even more laid back, but just as inspiring and evocative.  My favorites still tend toward the tracks that sound most similar to this duo's work together on Connected.  Tracks like ""Take Off the Blues"" and ""Something to Behold"" present shades of that first beloved album, but I am coming to enjoy and appreciate the other tracks more with each listen.  With the way Nicolay layers his tracks, it is very difficult to become bored when listening to this album (although it is VERY relaxing and soothing).<br /><br />I am sure that Connected, being their original brainchild, will always be their most well-received and praised effort, but it is hard not to appreciate an album like ""Leave It All Behind"" for all that it offers in terms of pure creativity and soulful music.<br /><br />I am officially STILL a huge Foreign Exchange fan.",[],B001EICD8E,B001EICD8E,AGTW6ZGPUAORQ7X6CNBP6PJW7OTA,2008-10-16 13:30:49.000,5,True,Harry Tabor - Man of the Decade?

Unfortunately it seems to be only on CD or digital.<br /><br />As the other reviews point out, this isn't exactly what FJB is best known for, so if you prefer their signature style, this album could be take it or leave it for you. I like their older style as well, and they definitely shine just as much with blues and folk as they do for this more modern pop fusion style. Reminds me a little of how Mumford and Sons did the same thing. They released an album with a slightly different modern style and a lot of their fans didn't care for it as much. Personally I like both styles.<br /><br />My favorite track is Kerosene. It has some really intriguing chords and key changes, not something I'm used to hearing.

Yet, I will happily listen to Arvo Pärt, Lera Auerbach, and other contemporary composers as I listen my way through the album playlist. Possibly my willingness to accept the newer things is that they are mixed in with work from the Baroque on up to the early 20th century, and done so seamlessly that it feels as if all the music is coeval.<br /><br />I discovered this album because of Hope's performance of Einaudi's Passaggio, which moved me to look for more Einaudi.  I found I Giorni on this album and, curious about what else might be included, I listened to the whole thing. (Thank you Amazon.

I also feel this beautiful instrumental music helps you access a spiritual dimension that is sacred. ""O Holy Night"" is especially meaningful. I listened to this album in a room filled with the scent of balsam fir needle. It was like having a Christmas tree early. You simply put some essential oil in an oil burner with some water. It makes the entire room fragrant and helps you recreate the feeling of Christmas. When you finish listening to this album you won't want it to end. It is so peaceful and relaxing.<br /><br />I can also recommend:[[ASIN:B001GNFYV0 Generations Of Yuletide]] for the holiday season.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received a free copy for review.",[],B009I4HN6I,B009I4HN6I,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2012-11-11 19:33:38.000,4,False,A beautiful (and delicious!) homage to the varied desserts of southern Italy
5.0,Might Help with New Year's Resolutions,If you are always planning to eat in a more healthy way then this is a DVD you should see to help you stick to your New Year's resolutions. Dr. Weil impresses me with his vibrant soul. His mind is sharp and he always looks happy. What is his secret? Well he takes a very balanced approach to eating. He believes you should enjoy food and that healthy food can taste good. In this DVD you will learn important things like how to read labels and figure out the glycemic index of foods. He covers all the basics of what you should and should not be eating. I liked how at the end of the DVD he thinks up the most unhealthy way of eating and then gives advice on the healthiest diets in the world. If you are looking for a fad diet you won't find one here. This way of eating is based on more traditional wisdom and a lifetime of experience.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,[],B00004TBFY,B00004TBFY,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2012-12-21 00:20:15.000,0,False,"Delicious, approachable Greek comfort food"
5.0,Practical Suggestions for a Healthier Life,"Dr. Weil has always been ahead of his time. In ""Spontaneous Healing"" he describes the future of medicine and what people really want a doctor to be.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Dr. Weil but I had yet to see this DVD which contains two programs. In the first program, ""8 Weeks to Optimum Health,"" Dr. Weil gives practical suggestions for how to live a healthier life. His advice encourages preventative care. Simple things like walking can make a big difference in your life. He starts off telling viewers to walk ten minutes a week and then as the weeks progress he explains you should be walking 45 minutes to an hour each day, or at least five days a week.<br /><br />Since Dr. Weil believes stress makes us sick he also gives some good breathing techniques that can lower your stress level any time of day. Most of the advice is good like who can argue that broccoli is not good for you. He also recommends grinding your own flax seeds, drinking green tea and eating more ginger.<br /><br />The only things I disagreed with was his advice to use canola oil and to eat soy products. I think the type of canola oil may be important. So while Dr. Weil does not reject conventional medicine he sees a future of integrative medicine where doctors take into account the whole person not just their symptoms. This DVD explains how resilience to disease can be developed and why the body has a wonderful healing system, if only we can get out of the way and let healing begin.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B00004W45C,B00004W45C,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2013-02-03 21:51:24.000,1,False,Promoting security and a sense of wonder!
5.0,A Euphoric Experience,"Ulrich Schnauss' new album has a rather uncertain start which turns strangely beautiful and ethereal. This contrasts with ""Broken Homes"" which seems to have discordant vocals, buzzing and scary voices at the end.<br /><br />Fortunately ""Like a Ghost in Your Own Life"" brings back an exuberant pleasant melody. This does not really prepare you for ""A Long Way to Fall"" which is spectacular and embodies a feeling of ecstatic love, hope and deep satisfaction. It is about as perfect and uplifting as a instrumental song can be. I could play this song obsessively and never tire of it. It makes me feel in love. There are subtle vocals where you can barely hear the words and yet the melody is extremely pleasant.<br /><br />The album then takes a darker turn at this point and becomes otherworldly. Dark rhythms take getting used to. The music is mysterious and becomes somewhat ecstatic. Bubbles seems to rise from a deep ocean and the music becomes exotic, complex and chaotic. Then it abruptly ends.<br /><br />The next track "" A Forgotten Birthday"" then turns beautiful with heavenly strains that permeate the mind and become more and more prominent. This track really captures the heart.<br /><br />""The Weight of Darkening Skies"" at first sparkles with creativity suddenly descends into darkness then becomes pleasant again only to become chaotic and distorted. ""Borrowed Time"" has indiscernible voices which are somewhat muffled. It is interesting and has unique sounds.<br /><br />""Ten Years"" is filled with regrets and a subtle intimacy. What is taken away is often replaced by something better. The mood of this track is in the end hopeful for a new beginning.<br /><br />At last we come to the last track which is ""A Ritual in Time and Death."" This is a fast-paced ride into and exotic experience. There is a strange musical collapse and then it sounds like wings flapping into eternity in echoes.<br /><br />Overall I'd say this album is a euphoric experience that you will want to repeat again and again. It is rather addictive even with a few moments of darkness amidst the glowing unrestrained light. ...reminiscent at times of Evening Ocean's [[ASIN:B004G2JM6Q The Kiss]].<br /><br />If you are wondering whether this is better than Goodbye I'd say it is not quite as overwhelming.

5.0,Blissfully Beautiful,"Ken Elkinson's ""Music for Telecommuting"" is a blissfully beautiful awakening from a dream. It is perfect for mornings as it adds a magical mood at the start of the day. The soft melodies help you relax into a state of calm. It is also perfect for any time during the day when you want to feel a sense of peace. I am always impressed with how perfect Ken Elkinson's music is. I'm a long-time fan of his music and listen to some of his CDs every night as I fall asleep.

5.0,Truly Beautiful Music from Vermont,"Denise Young is an obviously talented pianist but she is so much more. Her music connects with your heart and is almost magical in its eloquence. ""Something You Dream Of"" inspires a variety of positive emotions. You may feel elated, hopeful, peaceful or romantic while listening to this CD. All of the original compositions are very creative and will melt away your stress as you listen to this to relax, perhaps at the end of the day. The best way to listen to this music is in a quiet room filled with candles. You could also burn essential oils to enhance the relaxing mood.<br /><br />Denise Young's playing is beautiful on its own but is even more enhanced when she is accompanied by an English horn, violin, guitar, cello and clarinet. Each musician is masterful in their connecting with the original melodies.<br /><br />I think this CD in particular is excellent for Autumn when the nights are cooler. The pleasant piano melodies put you in a meditative mood. I play this when I just want to be alone with my thoughts.<br /><br />All of the pieces are instrumental except for ""Autumn Colors"" which includes vocals by Noah Wilding. She sounds like an angel from a faraway heaven.<br /><br />Some of my favorite pieces include:<br /><br />""I'll Smile"" which is hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />""Livia's Song"" which cradles the soul in serenity.<br /><br />and ""You Were Always There"" which is truly enhanced by the longing of the cello.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received this CD free for review.

We enjoyed listening to Matt Hammer playing his guitar and singing his creative songs.<br /><br />This CD has a good selection of covers and original songs that go together very well. There are songs about romantic longing, heartbreak, memories, falling in love, chivalry and dreams. The lyrics are honest and the melodies are magically calming.<br /><br />Some of the songs are a reminder that love can find anyone if they are open to it.

The cover of this DVD does not give any idea of how beautiful the scenes are within. If you like meditating while watching gorgeous scenes of nature then this will please you. You will travel through misty valleys, soar with birds in the air above water, watch the ocean surf churn and feel the chill of winter in the mountains. Each moment blends into the next moment as scenes change. I sat for over twenty minutes then lay down on my side so I could still watch to the end. This provides over 40 minutes of deep relaxation. The music itself is wonderful so you could also use this with closed eyes. I just find it fascinating to watch the changing seasons and the ocean waves.

4.0,"""I Salute the Light of God in You""","Father Thomas Ryan believes the body is a temple for God's spirit. He explains how we can pray with our entire body while doing yoga. He emphasizes that we should care for our bodies and should search for inner quiet.<br /><br />This DVD contains seven yoga prayers which focus on Christian principles. I would say this practice is intermediate to advanced. Those who have never done yoga before may feel this all over or especially in the back. Doing these routines takes a lot of muscular strength, balance and flexibility so you may want to go at your own pace first and really learn the moves before progressing to the sections with music.<br /><br />There are two ways of doing these yoga exercises. First there is a section of instructional sequences where Father Thomas Ryan leads you through each series of exercises. Then there is a section of musical sequences where there is no instruction just singing.<br /><br />So you can learn the yoga postures first and then follow along with the music the next time.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B0007Q6R04,B0007Q6R04,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2014-10-09 18:59:54.000,3,False,Write Your Future Into Life

I found this made me really relaxed and sleepy. Watching it once may not be enough. To continue the feeling of relaxation you might want to watch it twice.<br /><br />The film starts with flying above lavender clouds and proceeds to water dripping from ice, deserts with wild flowers, shimmering lakes, misty waterfalls and crashing ocean waves. You can imagine how delicate droplets turn into torrents in rapids. I liked the way light dances on the water in some scenes. Some of the contrasts are beautiful like turquoise water set against burnt orange landscapes.<br /><br />The music ranges from guitar to piano and flute. I want to find just a CD of the music featured on this DVD as I think it would help me get to sleep at night.<br /><br />So overall this is a good experience as long as you are aware that some of the DVD looks a little dated.

Phlilippe De Vitry (1291-1361) was most famous for writing the Ars Nova in 1320. He was an intellectual in France who was a poet, singer, composer, critic, author, bishop and scholar.

I especially enjoyed the loving, generous and open heart expanding ""A World of Peace and Beauty."" The title really seems to truly embody the feelings in the piano solo. And if you are in the mood for a little melancholy ""Mystery"" will impress you. ""Refreshing Rain"" was quite delicate and gorgeous. I enjoyed all the music on this CD and can recommend it to you.

5.0,Deeply Relaxing Nature Scenes and Music,"The Delta Sleep System is very effective. This DVD contains over an hour of peaceful images paired with flute music and sometimes piano. The music and images are very relaxing. I enjoyed the nature scenes of fuchsia flowers, flowing streams, crashing waves, mossy rocks, lush ferns and sunsets. There are also some scenes of majestic mountains with snow and rapidly flowing waterfalls. The fall foliage was also nice this time of year and the clouds reflected on wet beach sand was artistic.<br /><br />My experience with this DVD was that it took me from being stressed out to nearly asleep. I was watching it on the couch and about halfway through I lay down on the couch instead of sitting because I was getting sleepy. It felt like the music on the DVD helped to lower my blood pressure and took all thoughts out of my mind.<br /><br />So this is good for helping you fall asleep but it can also put you in a meditative trance. You will find yourself taking deeper breaths as you relax further.<br /><br />This also has a CD of ocean wave sounds which knocks me out when I listen to it at night in bed.

This is pretty relaxing as one image fades into the next providing a gentle sense of calm. The sunny meadows make you feel like you are really outside.<br /><br />What I found was the nature sounds really blend well with the music. There are wind chimes which make this whole DVD sort of magical. There are sounds of a sitar, a flute and maybe even Tibetan gongs. There are so many interesting sounds you will not be bored for an instant. Some scenes also show animals like birds, a horse and deer.<br /><br />I hear rain in this DVD in places but I didn't see any rain falling. There are other water sounds too and sometimes children chanting. The colors in this DVD are also gorgeous. Bright pink flowers, golden skies, emerald leaves and sapphire oceans leave you with a sense of wonder about God's creation.<br /><br />I guess what I liked most about this was the music.

You really do enter a different world when you listen to this sophisticated collection. If you listen to this with AKG headphones every note is pristine and magical. I mostly liked the music from the first three CDs. The fourth and fifth CDs are a little more dramatic and intense.<br /><br />Bach's Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring was very familiar to me. Also Brahms: Rhapsody in G minor is absolutely breathtaking. Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata makes you feel nostalgic.<br /><br />All the pianists playing the music are beyond accomplished. Julius Katchen played Mendelssohn's On Wings of Song so delicately. Vladimir Ashkenazy brings a new beauty to Chopin's works.<br /><br />This really was a trip down memory lane at times. Beethoven's Fur Elise was a piece I used to play on the piano by ear after I first heard it. You have probably heard a lot of this music in movies.<br /><br />So there is a lot to enjoy. I'll listen to the first three CDs much more than the last two.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,[],B000ICMF76,B000ICMF76,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2016-03-21 21:34:52.000,0,False,My first memories of reading!
3.0,A Journey to Many Beaches,Endless Oceans is relaxing to watch at the end of the day. This DVD will make you want to dig your toes into the sand. With that said I think this has some definitely different moments. The first track of music has a lot of bird sounds but most of the other tracks are just uplifting electronic music. The sound of breaking waves is very clear in one section. So the music is great.<br /><br />The scenes range from daytime with blue skies to sunrises and sunsets that fill the sky with brilliant colors. Sometimes they filmed at high tide and there are great waves and at other times they seem to have filmed at low tide when there are just ripples.<br /><br />At times one scene is superimposed on another creating an interesting viewing experience. One section is almost psychedelic with the whole scene undulating as if the beach was going up and down in a rhythmic motion. One of the scenes is digitally altered so the waves look like liquid metal.<br /><br />What I did like was at the end you see a sunset from beginning to end. There is also a great section with an orange sky and pastel blue waves. Sometimes the waves are close up and at other times the waves are far away down the beach. For about less than a minute one scene turns black and white.<br /><br />I think this will be enjoyed by the contemplative viewer. The glistening waves and the light dancing on the ocean will also appeal to the artistic soul.<br />There is also one scene of very fat contented seagulls all congregating on the beach. Something I've never seen before. So animal lovers will enjoy that.<br /><br />I think this could have been made better but it has its moments. The music is nice and there are plenty of scenes of great beauty. Just don't expect there to be waves close up the whole time.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,[],B00265T7KG,B00265T7KG,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2016-05-20 22:11:37.000,0,False,Please mail this letter to my mother....
4.0,Lots of Videos to Relax You,"When I first put this DVD in I saw four options: wind, water, earth, fire. So I thought this just had four videos. Well the first video was just leaves blowing in the wind, I figured that must be the wind video. Then there was a section on a car driving and filming rocks in the mountains beside the road. I figured that was the earth video. Then there is a video of light glinting off water. Then I watched some artwork flash around and figured well that was that, this must be done.<br /><br />Fortunately I didn't turn the DVD player off right away because more videos followed and they got more and more interesting. I especially liked the video of the horses and there was one with sailing which looked fun. You know how they say variety is the spice of life, well this has a lot of variety. There is even one video a scuba diver must have taken of fish and plants under the sea. So believe me when I say that if you make it through the first four videos there is much more to enjoy.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B000FSLMF4,B000FSLMF4,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2016-06-13 02:50:30.000,1,False,Tasty Food Facts with Recipes
4.0,Gorgeous Music and Entertaining Aquatic Animals,&#34;Underwater Peace&#34; is an amazing DVD that focuses on the underwater world. Most of it is relaxing with a soothing soundtrack of ambient electronica. There are various sections which have themes and the music to suit each new adventure. I thought the music itself had gorgeous melodies. One section gets a little more upbeat than the rest.<br /><br />What I liked about this DVD was how interesting the aquatic animals were. There are the cutest sea slugs and one octopus steals the show. There is a powder blue eel that looked a little scary and there is a section where someone very brave filmed sharks slinking and gliding around. Mostly though this focuses on colorful fish.<br /><br />This DVD made me think how absolutely infinite God's imagination is. So many of these animals are brilliantly unique.

4.0,Spiritually Uplifting Experience,If you are looking for music that creates a spiritually uplifting experience you might like this CD. I find it is nice to have playing while I'm reading religious books. It sounds almost like an orchestra but without the violins. There are also a few pieces which feature an organ.

5.0,The Evolution of  Chris Martin and his Band,"If you are a recent fan of Coldplay as I am and have their newest album it is fun to buy this set and go back in time to the beginnings of a musical odyssey. Chris Martin reveals an almost naïve vulnerability in his first album Parachutes and then evolves to an uncontained ecstasy in later albums. His voice really matures throughout these four albums.<br /><br />To me Chris Martin is a lyrical genius who captures real emotions and situations in poetic beauty. Some of the time he channels his pain into beautiful expressions of love gained and lost. I feel he has good insight into the human experience. At first he is singing about how he would bleed himself dry then in the last album he sings about not wanting to be part of death and all his friends. So it seems like he has a heightened consciousness where he values himself more in the end.<br /><br />Before I bought this set I thought X&amp;Y was the best album, but I was very surprised by A Rush of Blood to the Head. I'm almost thinking now that that album is better.<br /><br />The truth is when you get this set of CDs you will go into a Coldplay zone and play these albums over and over again for days on end. They really are that good and I admit I've been obsessing over them. I never had a band I liked this much in all my 48 years of living. To me Coldplay is the ultimate listening experience.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B009TO99TG,B009TO99TG,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2016-08-07 15:55:36.000,24,True,"Quot Libros, Quam Breve Tempus!"
4.0,Darkly Beautiful,"Chris Martin is strangely beautiful as a soul when he suffers emotionally. His voice becomes more vulnerable and darkly magnetic. While listening to this album and realizing what he's been through you can't help but want to give him a hug and tell him things will get better.<br /><br />I could relate to the lyrics and mood of this album because over twenty years ago I got dumped and it took me six years to get over it. So I can understand on this album how Chris Martin just can't seem to move on. When you have lost your soul mate things can be pretty bleak for a while. So this album is a little slower, darker and might make you cry because the emotions are so raw. It is definitely a break up album.<br /><br />Still this has one hit song on it that you might hear even in the grocery store as I did yesterday. A Sky Full of Stars is beautiful and it proves that even in the worst of romantic situations there is something positive to behold. Chris Martin even turns his emotional pain into gold.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B00IQE4NUK,B00IQE4NUK,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2016-09-26 21:25:07.000,2,True,The Adorable Bear Himself
5.0,Relaxing and Romantic,I'm a fan of the Philips Classics CDs and even buy them for friends and family because they are so good.

5.0,Calming Visual Journey with Music and Narration of Bible Verses from the New Testament,"&#34;He is Risen&#34; is a calming visual journey with music and voice over narration. The uplifting worship music ranges from laid back smooth jazz to reimagined hymns and organ music. As you are listening to the music, enjoying the narration and seeing Bible verses on screen, there are also beautiful visions of the earth and all her glory.<br /><br />At first there are cathedrals, stained glass windows, aerial views of mountains and waterfalls. Then there are coral reefs, seals, dolphins, whales, forests, wild horses roaming free, rainbows, ocean waves, parrots, amazon rain forests and some very funny sheep who are running for their lives as a plane goes overhead.<br /><br />Some of the most beautiful footage was of a huge waterfall. This DVD has literally the best waterfalls I've ever seen in a nature DVD. Later there are aquamarine lakes and vast expanses of glaciers.<br /><br />The combination of the lyrics and nature scenes is inspirational. You will feel love and admiration for God as you realize how wonderful nature really is.

5.0,Calming Original Story of a Toy Rabbit Becoming Real,"If you want to have a relaxing evening for yourself or a child, this story read by Meryl Streep is so comforting and cute. The mood begins with gentle piano. Meryl Streep's voice is intoxicating and soothing. The story is about a toy rabbit who longs to be real. He meets some real rabbits and longs to be like them.<br /><br />The boy in the story takes the rabbit on picnics on the grass but soon gets sick and feverish. When the boy gets well again the family is advised to get rid of anything the boy played with so he wouldn't get sick again. This means the rabbit is going to be destroyed. An awful thought that just can't come true as the boy loves this rabbit.<br /><br />But just in time a fairy arrives and makes the toy rabbit real. So this has a very happy ending except the boy and rabbit are separated and only see each other one more time at the end. This is the perfect story for a cold evening. It would also make a perfect gift for a new baby who can listen to the story and music which is relaxing and will help put the baby to sleep.<br /><br />So I recommend this to adults who love children's stories and children who love rabbits.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B00EQJ0VO6,B00EQJ0VO6,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2018-05-06 06:16:16.127,0,False,Your True Healing Potential
5.0,A Beautiful Spiritual Experience,I've been listening to Casting Crowns on my favorite radio stations for quite some time and I've always loved their lyrics. The DVD of their concert is a beautiful spiritual experience that focuses a lot on audience participation. Youth pastor Mark Hall gives some inspirational talks between songs and there are also some teaching videos included in the bonus section.<br /><br />The songs on the DVD include upbeat and deeply poignant selections. Some of the songs make the audience cry because they are so beautiful and meaningful. Casting Crowns produces music that feeds the soul. I loved how the singers' voices harmonized so beautifully. Andy Williams also gives the audience what they want when he plays an amazing drum solo. The Christians celebrating and worshipping in the audience is also inspirational. Songs you will recognize are &#34;Every Man&#34; and &#34;Slow Fade.&#34; I really enjoyed this concert and can recommend it to you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,[],B001CITRF8,B001CITRF8,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2018-06-17 19:07:05.406,0,False,Seasons of Love - What is Really Happening in Your Marriage?
4.0,Deeply Relaxing Escape - Piano with Nature Scenes - Mostly Winter!,"Dave Eggar's ""Serenity"" is a nature video with piano music. It is not a concert of Dave Eggar playing live as I thought it was going to be. The first scenes are brittle trees in a snowy landscape.<br /><br />There are some poetic moments like crisp white snowflakes falling on evergreen trees next to a sparkling lake. The sun also glints off rivers and streams. There is lots of ice and snow if you enjoy looking at mostly winter scenes.<br /><br />I kept expecting the seasons to change and in the last 15 minutes of this hour long DVD the seasons finally do change into spring, summer and autumn.<br /><br />What this DVD left me contemplating is what an artist God really is because he's created so many things of beauty in the world.

5.0,A Classic Holiday Experience,"When you order this classic holiday experience you may think you are going to listen to 42 tracks of music, but instead it is 19 tracks with some of the tracks being a medley of three or more songs. This works wonderfully as those tracks are based on a theme like ""Miraculous Night"" or ""Born Today"" or ""Rejoice.""<br /><br />Some of the songs you may recognize include: We Three Kings, Silent Night/Holy Night, O Little Town of Bethlehem and For Unto Us a Child is Born.<br /><br />This would be perfect to give as a gift to anyone who loves a choir singing with a symphony orchestra. I can think of a few people who would enjoy this Christmas music as a gift. The vocals on this are really beautiful and you can tell the choir singing is totally dedicated to producing the best music possible.<br /><br />I'm roasting a turkey breast and listening to this music. It feels like Christmas already!

5.0,Deeply Relaxing Lullabies for Adults and Kids who Want to Daydream,"Do you want to lower your blood pressure? I often do and this deeply relaxing CD of classic lullabies will help you daydream or stop thinking so much about stressful situations. This is perfect for listening while quietly reading.<br /><br />Because this was recorded in a recital hall, it feels like you are listening to this live. On AKG headphones this is blissful. By choosing this CD you will learn more about composers from Ireland, Russia, Germany, France, Poland and America.<br /><br />You will most likely instantly recognize some of these lullabies, like Frederic Chopin's Nocturne in D-flat major. But perhaps the most recognized lullaby is Johannes Brahms' cradle song which mothers everywhere know.<br /><br />This CD can be used as a jumping off point to discover composers who contributed to the music of the nocturne genre.<br /><br />The calming romantic violin playing of David Hays melds well with Peter Collin's precise, piano playing on a Steinway with an open heart. Together they work musical magic on the listener. If you love violin and piano you will enjoy this CD even more.<br /><br />I would not say that this music was created to fall asleep to as there are still plenty of energetic moments like Szymanowski's Notturno. But this may be best for escaping the world's problems for a little over an hour. Everyone needs a break from worry, stress and anxiety which is in no short supply momentarily. This CD will make you feel you have all the patience in the world and can handle the next challenge life sends your way.<br /><br />So listen to this beautiful album and enter the worlds of daydreams, visions and night dreams.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B00ASNZZZE,B00ASNZZZE,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2020-03-21 06:04:37.851,2,True,Encouraging Message of Hope For Those Who Desire Healing
5.0,Classic Christmas Nostalgia of a Gentler Time,"If you need a smooth dose of Christmas nostalgia this will make you feel warm and cozy. About two weeks before Christmas I get in the mood to listen to all my Christmas albums, normally when baking cookies. It just isn't the holiday season without Frank Sinatra. Normally I listen to his music on the radio or on other albums, so it is nice to finally have a whole CD dedicated just to his renditions.<br /><br />You will recognize lyrics like:<br /><br />""I'll be home for Christmas""<br />""Have yourself a merry little Christmas""<br />""The hopes and fears of all the years are met in Thee tonight:<br />""Silent Night, Holy Night""<br /><br />Most of the music on this album speaks of the emotional wishes of the heart at this time of year. I thought this was perfect with the orchestra and chorus and Frank Sinatra's calming voice.<br /><br />There are however two version of ""The Christmas Waltz"" so at the end you'll say to yourself: ""Didn't I hear that earlier?""

Within minutes of listening to this music I felt relaxation taking over and calmness entering my soul. My heart felt free and not so constricted.<br /><br />This music is continuous but you can still barely tell when a new track is starting. You may find this CD perfect in the evening as you are preparing for bed. It soothes and erases the troubles of the day so your mind is clear for sleep. You may even want to play this while you are falling asleep. That is the reason I bought it because I needed some new inspiration for relaxing dreams.

4.0,A Showcase of Lessons Learned and Love Lost - A Cry of a Soul in Emotional Torment!,"Over the years I've heard many Adele songs and she always seemed to be singing about one man from a long time ago that she seemed to have a hard time getting over. In this one she is again singing about men, men who do not appreciate her for the beautiful soul she is. My one thought after listening to this CD is that Adele needs to fall in love with God, not another man! Her soul is craving the unconditional love only God can give her. A man should be second place to God.<br /><br />Many of the songs on this album are like therapy sessions where she is talking about her issues, even crying openly. I admit it is somewhat difficult to listen to unless you've been through depression and can relate. As someone who has fallen in love and been hurt in the past I know human love in a relationship falls short of most people's expectations.<br /><br />One thing I did consider is that this CD is like a warning for people who listen to it. The lyrics about just wanting to have fun even when something is not right is a huge red flag. It shows what can happen to people when they have this attitude and don't consider their spiritual health. Everyone makes mistakes!<br /><br />The battle between the heart and mind can lead a person to a state that is not pleasant to live in. Either Adele has learned this valuable lesson or she will make more albums with her pain. Yes, it is hard to try, we all can relate. But she can be free an happy again if she focuses more on God and less on men to satisfy the cry of her emotional torment.<br /><br />My copy was also cracked on the front and it was sent in a box!

5.0,A Beautiful Christmas Album You Will Enjoy Year After Year!,"The majesty of Christmas music and Josh Groban's voice were made for each other. His creative renditions of these familiar songs are just amazing and will command your full attention. Listening to this album is an experience all its own. It will instantly put you in a holiday mood. This was a gift to myself, but I'm considering buying it for my friends.<br /><br />Perhaps the most beautiful song as far as melodies go is ""I'll be Home for Christmas."" Expect to feel like crying. Christmas is sometimes about missing people as much as it is about celebrating. This song reminded me of Christmases at my Grandmother's house where there was always so much happiness and love.<br /><br />""Ave Maria"" is stunning and embodies the holiness of Christmas. ""Thankful"" is thoughtful and I'd never heard it before. The lyrics are very meaningful and hopeful. ""The Christmas Song"" is very familiar but with acoustic guitar it is especially beautiful.<br /><br />""Christmas Time is Here"" explores the wonder of the season. ""Believe"" is haunting. The lyrics are very encouraging. ""O Holy Night"" is the perfect completion to this album.<br /><br />With a good balance of religious and secular songs, this album captures all the emotions of Christmas. The sadness, the joy, the longing for peace. The orchestration is perfect and the choirs magnificent.<br /><br />Listening to Josh Groban sing Christmas songs on the radio inspired this purchase. His voice is gorgeous on every song and I can see now why this is such a popular album. I've really never heard anything this beautiful.

I'd not suggest women give this to their husbands unless the husband doesn't mind being called sweetie or sweetie pie! Frank Sinatra is mostly singing about the love of a man for a woman. Which makes us women weak in the knees and susceptible to romance. Some of the songs are a little jazzy and invigorating but most are just love songs you could listen to while you relax. I'm thinking some hot chocolate and some intimate conversation while you listen.

5.0,Spiritual Guidance and Comfort - Plays in my CD Player Fine! :),"If you are world weary and are seeking comfort you will love this spiritual and healing guided meditation with a focus on Jesus' love and how God shapes us into who we are supposed to be like a potter would shape a clay vessel.<br /><br />What this meditation makes you realize is the most important thing is that you are secure in God's love. No matter what anyone says or does to you, God cares about your soul like a loving father.<br /><br />This is a spoken word and musical journey that seems geared for women who need some solitude. It reminds me of a spiritual spa experience with visualization.<br /><br />I started listening to this when I was really upset and the music was so emotionally soothing that I felt calmed down in a few minutes and my negative emotions seemed sedated.<br /><br />The scripture quoted along with the music shows the beauty and power of God's words to reassure the soul. So if you are in need of comfort as I was when I started listening or you just want to relax there is something for everyone.<br /><br />This is a rare recording that I think you will love to listen to whenever you need it. It will give you a new perspective on your life. The only thing I will say is that the way this is recorded is a bit different than what I'm used to. When the narrator speaks there is a slight fuzziness to the recording.

5.0,A Relaxing Escape into Meditation and Progressive Muscle Relaxation!,"If you are stressed out and anxious, this spoken word guided meditation and visualization will help you feel more relaxed. The piano music that accompanies this is really beautiful and electronica based. It sets the mood and helps your heart beat a little slower.<br /><br />Alain Charise encourages you to take deep full slow breaths. His voice is also pleasant and soothing.<br /><br />This seems nonreligious except that he talks about leaving things you don't want on an altar. There are no prayers to gods or goddesses and no invitation for them to help you in this meditation. So that was what I was looking for!<br /><br />You will enjoy the progressive relaxation exercises and feel the tension melting away. At the end of the guided meditation there is a segment of five minutes where you meditate on your own. By then you are fully relaxed so it feels good to be just left in a state of peace. Alain Charise comes back to let you know when the time is up and to conclude the session.<br /><br />You may want to do this meditation lying down in a warm bed so you can fully relax. I tried this at first sitting up in a chair but that is not ideal. For people over 50 like me, sitting in a lotus posture is also not that comfortable for a long time. This would also be perfect to listen to before sleep.<br /><br />I started this meditation when I was feeling anxious and felt so much better after completing the calming about 30 minute practice.<br /><br />If you are new to meditation or just hate sitting by yourself in silence, then guided meditation may work great for you. I know I prefer to be guided and not left alone with my own thoughts for too long. It really is the thoughts that make you stressed out, so this gives you a needed break!

5.0,Rare Relaxation CD for Christians - Spiritual Guidance that is Calming to the Soul!,"It is really rare to find a meditation CD that melds Christianity with relaxation. On this CD there are two tracks. One is a spoken word guided meditation with scripture passages that calm the soul. The second track is just relaxing music.<br /><br />Everett's voice is soothing and his spiritual guidance is healing to the spirit and mind. The emphasis of this meditation is to let go of tension and negative thoughts and to trust God more fully.<br /><br />The beginning of this CD is progressive muscle relaxation. Everett also includes some prayers and they sound beautiful with the background of the synthesized piano music. An interesting section also looks back on the perfect Eden God first created.<br /><br />By listening to this and following the instructions you will experience a filling of joy and enjoy more spiritual clarity.<br /><br />So there is about 14 minutes of guided meditation and the rest is calming music. I find even just listening to the music track is very comforting. If you are feeling anxiety and want to experience more peace, this is an excellent meditation that will help you meet your goals for relaxation while also helping clear your mind so you can feel more love and serenity.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B001MYIRC6,B001MYIRC6,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2022-02-16 00:27:50.814,0,True,"A lovely tale of matchmaking, true love and modern India"
5.0,Helps Even After One Day!,"Yesterday I was very anxious and was clenching my jaw. Fortunately this CD arrived and I was able to work through all three hypnosis sessions before going to bed. I woke up and I noticed I did not have as much tension in my jaw, I was not clamping it shut, just sort of relaxing and keeping my mouth open. Which is what the hypnosis instructions told me to do. So very impressed that it worked so fast and today I have not been clenching my jaw at all. This to me is a small miracle.<br /><br />What this does is take you through a session of visualizations. It is very comforting and relaxing. Once you are in a deep state of relaxation you will be introduced to the idea that things can change for the better and that you will no longer clench your jaw. The suggestions are powerful and safe. I felt extremely relaxed and ready to accept the positive messages. I never once lost any consciousness just was in a state where the words could sink deeply into my subconscious. There are images of laying on the grass or going down steps. When she counts down as you are visualizing the steps, it is to get you to keep letting go of stress and anxiety. Very effective. She also counts up at the end when you are going to ""wake up"" out of the hypnosis state.<br /><br />I found this very comforting, relaxing and healing. I will look for other Self-Hypnosis CDs by Rachael Eccles. She's a very loving wonderful guide who has a deeply soothing voice and really has a handle on hypnosis. I think you will be impressed how this helps even after only one day. I'm going to continue to listen to it so that my habits will be totally broken and I can be permanently free from teeth grinding.<br /><br />This CD has three sessions:<br /><br />Teeth Grinding Listen and Wake - For daytime listening.<br />Teeth Grinding Lite-Speed Hypnosis - a 5 minute session when you are short on time.<br />Teeth Grinding Bedtime Hypnosis - Perhaps the most effective session if you want to be calm and fall asleep fast.<br /><br />I'm so happy I found this and can recommend it to you highly!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B004QOIPDK,B004QOIPDK,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2022-02-23 20:59:05.052,0,True,"Despite loving the original, I just couldn't get into it"

I enjoyed the counting of the stairs as I sank into deeper and deeper relaxation. This may also work for you if you wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep.

5.0,A Deeper Place of Tranquility - Think More Positively Effortlessly and Easily with Hypnosis!,"Life is stressful! That is an understatement and sometimes it feels comfortable to sink into negative thinking to cope. This is when you need someone wise and caring to encourage you to relax and consider all your options. Being depressed does not feel like a choice, it feels more like a weight that is holding you back from happiness. This hypnosis CD helps you to stop thinking negative thoughts. It also encourages you to rewire your brain for positivity.<br /><br />Rachael seems to know exactly what to say to calm your soul into a deep place of tranquility. As she says: ""You have the power to choose to only think positive thoughts."" This gentle advice is welcome when you need someone to understand how fragile you are.<br /><br />This CD will help you think more positively effortlessly and easily. OK some retraining of the mind is involved but with hypnosis you will really get deep into your subconscious mind and want to make changes naturally.<br /><br />This CD has a waking hypnosis at the start and a hypnosis to lead you into deeper sleep at the end. So two choices for a better life! If you lie awake at night thinking and thinking then the sleeping hypnosis may really work for you. After it is over there is calming music to help you drift into dreams. I like doing both hypnosis sessions back to back and I have been able to wake myself up at the end by counting from 5 to 1 myself. I find listening to the whole CD makes me the most relaxed.<br /><br />I've decided why suffer in life any more than you have to.

If you love jazz, you will adore this album. I also thought Moonlight Serenade was beautiful. So if you love old-fashioned romance you may enjoy this music. It is the next best thing to having these songs on vinyl. This music creates a mood that is hard to duplicate in today's world.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B00000AUNE,B00000AUNE,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2022-05-29 01:32:23.372,0,True,A beautiful (and delicious!) homage to the varied desserts of southern Italy
5.0,Serene Soothing Soulful Piano! Extremely Relaxing!,This CD arrived right as I was going to cook dinner so I decided to listen to it while I was in the kitchen. It was serene and it felt very soulful and extremely relaxing. I feel that Laura Sullivan has a beautiful sensitivity to her playing and these artistic interpretations of classical selections are hauntingly romantic. The exquisite cello and violin awakens the heart while the piano is psychologically calming. I thought this was perfect and I will listen to this again and again. My husband came into the kitchen and said this sounded like music he would have heard at a party years ago. He's a big fan of classical music so happy he loves this too. We also played this CD during dinner a night later and it we had a really good conversation. I think the classical music calms you and makes you more open to communicating. I also tried this for helping me sleep and it works! :))<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,[],B01LYF5VXI,B01LYF5VXI,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2022-10-24 02:34:39.567,0,True,A beautiful memento of vacations Up North
5.0,Captivating Soul Calming Singing with Inspirational Heartfelt Lyrics!,Josh Groban's voice always gives me shivers it is so beautiful. I've been a fan of his voice for a long time now but had never watched a concert. It was cute that he was so chatty between songs and he had a lot of interesting things to say about humanity and the longings of our souls. I felt the original emotionally sophisticated lyrics went well with his powerful mesmerizing voice.<br /><br />The sapphire lights made the stage glow with iridescent beauty. The violins and cellos added a heartfelt depth and real emotions. All the musicians and singers are in their most beautiful and creative energy and are really in their element. Josh Groban introduces everyone with real generosity of spirit. He shares the stage with some of the most talented people I've ever seen in a concert.<br /><br />The only thing I wished for were subtitles and some song translations. Two songs however are guaranteed to make you cry. This concert has a real wow factor and the audience is great. I'm happy I found this and got to see Josh in concert. Anytime I just need to feel love and peace I will watch this.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,[],B07NBDYKJT,B07NBDYKJT,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2022-10-28 03:53:50.411,0,True,Death by Ghirardelli Chocolate...
5.0,Sophisticated Spiritual Songs from the Soul!,"The beginning of this album is otherworldly but turns hauntingly beautiful, then melancholy and sometimes chaotic. The voices are at times discordant yet angelic. If you look at the English translation of the lyrics you will understand the mood of many of the songs more.<br /><br />What you will notice is the beauty of the native Icelandic language. The 13th century poem turned into a hymn-like prayer is also very melodic.<br /><br />There is a sense of longing for eternal rest and an appreciation of life's beautiful moments amidst the struggle. Two songs are actually love poems.<br /><br />I think what summarizes the thoughts in a lot of these songs are the lyrics:<br /><br />""When our poor souls<br />pass away from this world,<br />take us, God to you,<br />into your everlasting glory.""<br /><br />I have rarely heard anything as beautiful as these sophisticated stunning songs from the soul. There is also an instrumental piece at the end featuring violins. Your life will be enhanced by the experience of listening to these heartfelt melodies and poignant lyrics. The mood of an icy landscape comes through very well too. This is an album you will look forward to listening to over and over again as you contemplate the lyrics.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B09M5L414L,B09M5L414L,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2022-11-07 22:11:02.050,0,False,A loving glance at a vanished world
5.0,Highly Spirited Christmas Music - Mannheim Steamroller in Concert in December 2014!,"Over the years I've heard Mannheim Steamroller music on the radio at Christmastime and I've always thought it was very high-spirited Christmas music. This is a combined recording of two concerts they did at the Orpheum Theater in Omaha, Nebraska. It runs for about an hour so plenty of music to enjoy. If you want more music there are five bonus performances that you can play one after the other so it extends the concert a bit.<br /><br />Some of the music is very recognizable like Faeries and O' Little Town of Bethlehem. I also loved Carol of the Bells and Silent Night which was performed by Chip Davis and his two daughters. His daughter, Elyse Davis also sings Greensleeves beautifully.<br /><br />This concert makes use of modern and classical instruments. Violins play along with electric guitar, flute and drums play along with French horns and a harpsichord. It is really all quite beautiful. I thought at times there were echoes of the medieval which make it memorable.<br /><br />While watching this concert, Chip Davis does commentary between songs and an introduction before the concert starts. I found that very enjoyable and it added new dimensions to the understanding of how this music was produced. It is worth watching to see his pet wolf and horses.<br /><br />The musicians also seem to be having such fun so it was as interesting to watch them play their instruments as it was to hear the music itself. They seem to be expressing so much Christmas joy and when they play the more reverential selections like O Holy Night you can sense that they know the meaning of Christmas itself.<br /><br />I enjoyed this concert in the comfort of my living room. It is fun to be transported to various locations to listen to Christmas concerts. I think if you are a fan this will be an essential item in your collection.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B0154XT78S,B0154XT78S,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2022-11-08 03:01:41.305,1,True,Just like what your (grand)mothers used to bake
5.0,"Romantic, Sacred and Secular Songs for Silent Nights and Sweet Nostalgic Moments!","From its magical beginnings you will enter a holiday mood that makes you feel romantic, sacred, and nostalgic. Michael Buble has all the charm of Frank Sinatra and he sounds like him in many ways because his voice is so classically beautiful.<br /><br />I enjoyed how Santa Baby was adapted for a guy singing it. Some of the songs are also inspired by Jazz and Big Band sounds. Others are holy like Ave Maria. Silent Night has a beautiful children's choir singing so perfectly.<br /><br />So many famous people helped produce this album, like David Foster. This has a more classic sound in places, I'd even say it can be a little comforting in an old-fashioned way.<br /><br />As you drink your spiced apple cider or hot chocolate while listening to this album you may also want some ginger cookies and candlelight.<br /><br />The only thing I'd say is Cold December Night seems a little more adult in its intentions. Probably this romantic song was written for Michael Buble's wife. So I'd recommend this album to married couples who want to add some spice and love to their holiday festivities.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B005H0IW6W,B005H0IW6W,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2022-12-05 20:49:22.429,0,True,A wake-up call on eating and living green for kids and their parents
5.0,An Addictive Ethereal and Hypnotic Experience You Will Want to Repeat!,"Ulrich Schnauss' and Jonas Munk's new album is at first crisp, clean and clear, then this music turns hypnotic and ethereal with spectacular lush layering. You are on a journey to the stars but there is almost a nostalgia for what has been.<br /><br />Return to Burlington pops and blurs with reverberations. Such an original exploration of sound and echoes that lightens the heart and awakens the consciousness. It gave me shivers! It is really order appearing out of chaos.<br /><br />Solitary Falling is instantly memorable in mood and the way it relaxes you into a serene acceptance of what has been. If there is a promise here it is that in the end everything will be as it should be. There is a casual finality to the conclusion.<br /><br />Perpetual Motion sounds like expanding bubbles floating up from a deep ocean. It is ecstatic while remaining centered. The subtle beats make you feel like you are moving forward into the future. Ten and a half minutes lets you saturate in the sounds which is rather blissful. Nearer the end there is some discordance which is interesting as the bubbles start to pop at the top of the water. It is your soul vibrating at a higher frequency. Intoxicating!<br /><br />Narkomfin has echoes of guitar that are so magical in that they bring in a whole romantic element. The music is like pure soft love flowing out of the keyboard and guitar in a kind and contemplative moment.<br /><br />Faint Lights in the Distance invites you into a symphony of sounds that bounce off each other with a subtle energy. You will become instantly intrigued by the interplay of melodies that merge at the end into otherworldly realms and heavenly emotions.<br /><br />Along Deserted Streets is at first sparkly with a new found freedom in a peaceful serenity. Something is transitory yet melodic with beautiful harmonies of longing.<br /><br />The album ends with Polychrome which is more ambient with soft yet rhythmic beats. It invites you into an intimate conversation of the soul where you are accepted and loved in nurturing notes which numb all the negative emotions and release a compelling joy in distant angelic vocals.<br /><br />This whole experience makes me happy to be alive to hear the music and to experience all the original sounds and layers. I didn't think Ulrich could produce something as addictive as Goodbye, but he has gone far and beyond my expectations. You will treasure this album!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B08Z11YF72,B08Z11YF72,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2023-01-05 02:04:58.475,0,True,A mouthwatering combination of memoirs and great Southern pies
4.0,Get Lost in an Intricate Hypnotic Electronica and Guitar Bliss!,"Passage begins with a predominately guitar mood with Ulrich Schnauss adding the reverberations and echoes. Amaris is a piece that you will get lost in until Jonas Munk pulls you from the depths in an ecstatic guitar joy. It is magnificent in its power and scope.<br /><br />Genau Wie Damals hisses and blurs with faraway keyboards, then seems to advance into new territory with dramatic guitar and layering. This is almost hypnotic and the ending is so peaceful.<br /><br />Deep percussion introduces a fragile keyboard which contrasts nicely with captivating melodies that feel romantic. Such is Anywhere But Here. The guitar seems to be asking where you'd rather be. This is stunning in its gorgeous beauty.<br /><br />Intervention: Sol has a shaky start but it leads into captivating melodies. It is very short.<br /><br />MST has much heavier repetitive beats that make it sound like a drum solo with a keyboard accompaniment. Also it seems to have elements of piano and violin. I love the ending more than the start.<br /><br />Ao Hinode is bright and sparkly with piano and warm humming. A chorus of random playfulness seems to emerge. Ideas are being born in this album for future albums. I can hear their echoes in later compilations. The static at the end adds texture.<br /><br />Spellbreaker has heavier beats making it sound a little clunky in its discordance and organized chaos. Another piece that sounds like a drum solo.<br /><br />Intervention: Stjerner feels dated back to the 80s like it was created with an older synthesizer but then it melts into electronica bliss. Really it ends too quickly.<br /><br />Caffeine Blues has a mellow mood with intoxicating guitar and a blissful fusion of sophisticated sounds that have an ethereal beauty.<br /><br />Intervention: Mane is dreamy and hypnotic with warm whispers of waves washing over your whole consciousness. You will find this very relaxing and I think it could have gone on for five more minutes at least!<br /><br />Coastal Path feels like falling into a trance, maybe like when you fall in love and are romantically inspired to great creativity. You will feel especially happy while listening to this piece of music as it is a deep sigh of hope.<br /><br />I almost love describing this music as much as I enjoy listening to it. If you love this album, you will adore the more recent album Eight Fragments of an Illusion which I'm listening to a lot! I only took one star off this album because I don't prefer drum solos and some of the pieces were too short to really saturate in the sounds. Otherwise it is great. I like that in more recent albums the tracks are longer so you can really relax into them. I find listening to Ulrich's music while cooking in my kitchen makes everything better and it is a great experience.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B01N1PQAFN,B01N1PQAFN,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2023-02-06 01:26:21.464,0,True,A sweet story about believing in yourself
5.0,Extremely Beautiful Lyrics of Hope and Love!,After reading the Out of the Dark autobiography I decided to get the companion CD and I am very impressed by the extremely beautiful lyrics that speak of Hope and Love!<br /><br />The first song is like an anthem for survivors of depression and grief and the words made me cry real tears. I think Mandisa captures your heart with her thoughts and she's so relatable and human in her recovery from grief. The lyrics actually speak of victory in the face of difficulty.<br /><br />I've heard two of the songs on Christian radio but hearing all the songs was quite the experience. I'd say some of these songs are more bouncy soul pop while others are more serious. Either way you will find songs you can relate to no matter where you are in life or what you are facing. Yay Mandisa - she made it through with God's help and a lot of caring friends! :)))<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,[],B06XSKTDK9,B06XSKTDK9,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2023-02-15 21:21:30.914,0,True,A beautiful mixture of cultures and memories
5.0,Energetic Explorations Into Musical Ecstasy!,"No Further Ahead Than Tomorrow is true to its name in the amazing free fall of ""Melts into Air."" This album is an invitation into ethereal worlds of optimism and escape from stress. It transports you out of daily cares into an ecstatic remembrance of why it is great to be alive to hear this music. So much love and energy flows through this track.<br /><br />""Love Grows Out of Thin Air"" has heavier beats but also a delicate nature like butterfly wings in the sunshine. Then it increases in intensity with washes of sounds like crashing waves. I loved the popping bubbles from a deep ocean. There is so much going on in this track but it all melds together wonderfully like it was meant to be.<br /><br />""The Magic in You"" is more magnetic and has driving beats. This track is highly energetic and playful all while remaining centered on a theme. This track has vocals with meaningful lyrics all while attempting to burst your emotional heart wide open. It is gorgeous!<br /><br />""Thoughtless Motion"" is more subdued with crackling static and swirls of organized chaos. It includes a thunderstorm which surprises you and vocals that sound like an AI voice singing.<br /><br />""No Further Ahead Than Today"" is softer and more melodic with a sense of finality as if Ulrich is saying don't worry about more than today because the future will work itself out. I feel peaceful, yet expectant and then the music opens up into soul shivering sounds. I literally get goosebumps from this track. It is powerful, yet eternally happy and beautiful.<br /><br />""Wait for Me"" has intermittent dance beats with layers of keyboards that echo and reverberate. There is a perfection that awakens into deep sighs of hope. This really kicks in the dopamine and serotonin. It is a blissful release of emotions. You will just feel so happy listening to this track.<br /><br />""New Day Starts at Dawn"" is fast paced and somewhat discordant like a harmonica. Then the music expands your consciousness with guitar. At the end you can almost imagine a sunrise as it slowly appears.<br /><br />""Water Under the Bridge"" is at first ambient and then turns more dynamic and there is a creaking of an ancient tree with violins. It is a chaotic beauty that turns into a sublime symphony which then morphs into a massage for your mind.<br /><br />""Negative Sunrise"" appears slightly ominous with energetic rhythms and sacred bells intermingling with sonorous melodies. It is an electronica dream.<br /><br />""Illusory Sun"" takes its place last on the album with a big finish that has ancient and modern harmonies that play off each other and leaves you feeling ecstatic.<br /><br />What I noticed most about this album was how it made me keep taking in deep breaths and then releasing stress in out breaths. For music this energetic I was amazed at how relaxed this made me feel. Another great album by a master of electronica worlds. Listen to this on AKG K553s for the most immensely beautiful experience. That is what I listen to all of Ulrich's music on for sure!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B084THWP38,B084THWP38,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2023-02-19 23:41:13.186,0,True,"An entertaining twist on fitting in with the ""in crowd"""
5.0,A Magical Musical Mind Melt! Relaxing and Unique!,"Destiny Waiving seems to stop and start before it totally mellows out into a guitar dream and deep bass reverberations. It is more edgy than most of Ulrich's albums with a very European flavor at the start. You enter the first track expectantly and then you are taken through swirls of sounds into magical worlds of electronical that seduces the senses into subtlety.<br /><br />I find Ulrich's albums are intimate journeys and each one is unique and intriguing. The guitar on ""hindsight is 20/20"" is warm and inviting offering creativity and calmness. It is less tripped out than when Jonas Munk is playing with Ulrich and seems more grounded and classical while remaining inventive. Ulrich's playing merges seamlessly with the guitar in a sort of symphonic bliss with angelic vocals humming!<br /><br />""circular time"" really does feel like the music is spinning in a circular motion to soft violins. you feel pulled into a sound vortex! Nothing can rescue you now as you are in a mellow world of relaxing reverberations far from reality. It felt like my mind melting as the music faded out into the distance.<br /><br />""chiaroscuro"" wakes you up with its gorgeous melodies and guitar harmonies. This is a sunny day out in nature with warm undertones and yet there is sparkly rain dancing on pools of liquid consciousness. This ends with a deep sigh of peace. Mark Peters is a master or guitar guru leading you into world of mental relief from stress.<br /><br />""words can be dismissed"" is at first gentle piano that melds into ethereal waves. Wow is this beautiful! On AKG K553s you will be amazed at the clarity. I definitely recommend listening to all Ulrich's music on AKG K553s because sounds appear that are less apparent on other headphones. It is a total immersive experience.<br /><br />Fuzzy sonic whispers melt into a trance like melody in ""speak in capitals."" This is Ulrich just having fun! You can hear his playfulness all while he gives you serious things to contemplate. Vocals diffuse into guitar as keyboards fade. This ends with a sort of musical massage for the mind.<br /><br />""clair-obscur"" is dreamy and riveting all at once. Mark Peters really draws out the ecstasy of the guitar on each stirring string. I felt so mellowed out and relaxed while listening to this track. It could have gone on for five more minutes and I would not have complained!<br /><br />""so far, the moment"" is ecstatic in its mellow moods and meanderings. Ulrich seems to be leading you into a deep sleep. You will feel like you are sinking into the sounds. It is a little discordant to wake you up again. Then the dopamine and serotonin fully kick in and you will feel so happy. The ending is oceanic and pristine with flutters of bird wings and melancholy echoes.<br /><br />Overall a very satisfying musical escape with plenty of unique sounds. This is unlike any of the other Ulrich albums in my now starting to be vast collection!

4.0,An Electronica Blast from the Past!,"Classic Ulrich from over 20 years ago still has a universal appeal. You enter this album expectant and it takes you on a carefree journey of relaxation and mental release. This was one of the first electronica albums I ever heard and it is not as layered as ""Goodbye"" or later albums. It has a purity of sound that is unique to Ulrich's earlier albums. There are however more rhythmic elements on this album that make you feel like you are on a train riding into the future to some new adventure.<br /><br />What captivates me about this music is its solitary beauty and the beginnings of the metamorphosis that has led to Ulrich's brilliant later albums. But I think Ulrich was always on the cutting edge even at the beginning because there is a sparkle to his music that has kept me a fan all these years. It is rare for me to want to collect all of an artist's albums as I am doing lately!<br /><br />The tracks on this album are also long enough that you can saturate in the sounds for an immersive experience. So if you want to go back in time and are intrigued with electronica's evolution you will find this still has a lot of warmth and memories but the synthesizer sounds and persistent drum beats do date this album a bit here and there.<br /><br />""Nobody's Home"" on this album seems like a breakthrough into more like what Ulrich was really capable of and what his music was becoming.<br /><br />The bonus disc has music that also emphasizes the heavier drum beats. ""Sunday evening in your street"" has an experimental feel. ""Crazy for You"" is worth hearing and has a soothing repetitive nature and is almost hypnotic. ""Wherever you are"" has echoes of future albums that branch off into musical ecstasy like Goodbye.<br /><br />To be honest, this was my introduction to Ulrich's music and I'm glad I got to hear it again. It shows me what electronica used to sound like and how far things have progressed.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review, a fan",[],B0007LLOVG,B0007LLOVG,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2023-02-25 01:19:43.154,0,True,"A beautiful, heartbreaking look at love and loss in prerevolutionary Iran"
4.0,The Many Moods of an Electronica Artist's Heart!,"Initially, the album A Strangely Isolated Place has the haunting feeling of desolation with warm synthesizer and angelic vocals. It seems to be a journey into nostalgia. It has the same drum beats as ""Far Away Trains Passing"" but is more evolved with newer sounds. What I noticed about Ulrich's earlier albums is his love of water sounds like rain storms and fountains.<br /><br />This album however has a driving force of optimism to it even though the vocals can at times be melancholy. For instance ""On My Own"" seems like a break up song with lyrics like ""I don't need you."" It ends in psychedelic swirls of chaos that are then balanced by a delicate conclusion.<br /><br />""A letter from home"" is gorgeous in its simplicity but it does have those driving beats that are less prominent in later music.<br /><br />""Monday - Paracetamol"" is more expansive in consciousness and has familiar melodies. A thunder storm appears and then there are warm washes of sound enveloping your mind.<br /><br />""Clear Day"" is intense.<br /><br />""Blumenthal"" is dreamy with guitar and lonely landscapes with a sense of joy. The xylophone sounds are pretty.<br /><br />""In All the Wrong Places"" has the sounds of outer space planets with softer beats and more xylophone sounds which give it a magical feel and this then includes angelic vocals with a few falling stars.<br /><br />""A Strangely Isolated Place"" seems happy to be existing as a warm ending with radiant bursts of light. Then there seems to be a hidden track that plays afterwards and you can only access it by listening to track 8.<br /><br />Ulrich seems to have been exploring many moods of his soul on this album. There is dark moody chaos and also bright brilliant love which becomes more prominent as his albums progress into the future. It would be interesting to read an autobiography and find out what was going on in his life around the time this album was created!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B0002CHK18,B0002CHK18,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2023-02-25 01:33:22.020,0,True,A feast for body and soul
4.0,Unique Explorations of Soundscapes and Daydreams!,"""Tomorrow is Another Day"" is a gorgeous collaboration by the one and only Ulrich Schnauss and amazing guitarist Mark Peters who seem to know no limit to their creativity and have melded their minds together for a common goal.<br /><br />The synthesizer on this is warm and the guitar playing is beyond engaging. Occasionally there is discordance but it seems to facilitate the mental release when things turn back to harmonious.<br /><br />I don't think of this album as one track after the other, but more a progression in a mood that begins expectantly and ends in a serene solitary daydream.<br /><br />What I notice most about this album is its lack of too much overt drama and an abundance of peaceful serenity. The exception to this rule is ""Inconvenient Truths"" which seems to have more driving beats but opens up into an ecstatic guitar which is worth waiting for, along with the falling stars that I hear in Ulrich's music occasionally.<br /><br />Mark Peters and Ulrich are on the same wavelength and seem to read each other's thoughts on how the music should progress making this a very feel-good album, especially with the warm vocals.<br /><br />I think lovers of electronica will find much to enjoy here, especially in ""Walking with My Eyes Closed"" which seems intellectual and somewhat chaotic.<br /><br />""Rosmarine"" has an elegance that is captivating in its ambience. I could listen to a whole album with this mood and maybe I'll find one soon as I've been collecting all of Ulrich's albums!<br /><br />""There's Always Tomorrow"" concludes the experience with a hopeful note that is dreamy and lush with tripped out guitar and classical piano fading off into the distance.<br /><br />All too soon this album is over and I felt it could have gone on for 20 minutes longer!

With this two CD set you can experience the world of Ludovico Einaudi in all its splendor.<br /><br />I have rarely heard the piano played with such velvet soft sensitivity and majestic power all at once. The cello and violin are also haunting and heart stirring not to mention unforgettable. You will wonder what kept you from this beauty until the exact right moment in time.<br /><br />What this music sounds similar too is the heartbeat of all your most wonderful moments. Like the experience of heavenly realms, words will fail you in describing the intricacies of each note. Listening on the AKG K553s the piano sounds otherworldly.

It is truly spectacular as a mood inducing soundtrack.<br /><br />So if you wish you could get away to a beach but you don't want to have to drive across the country, this is the perfect relaxing escape that will soon help you dissolve into tranquility.<br /><br />As far as ocean sounds go, this is the best CD I've found so far and I have several.

If you are trying to escape from negative emotions and just want your body and mind to chill out in the evening, this is amazing for stress. Anxiety drains away with each track. It seems like this is set up to lead you deeper and deeper into serenity. This music is less expensive than therapy and you can repeat the experience whenever you like.

4.0,Hauntingly Familiar Melodies Remixed!,"Warm synthesizer introduces ""Her and the Sea"" and it is at first moody. Then it opens up into beautiful melodies and moments worth waiting for. This is the heart of Ulrich you know so well if you've been following his music since the beginning. There are depths of emotion here that speak of a very complex and beautiful soul expressing a love for music that is contagious to the listener.<br /><br />""Broken Homes"" sounds like liquid electronica raindrops falling on vinyl. There is more static and falling stars. This track has a bit of texture electronica fans love. It is discordant and distant like a faraway planet but close and intimate in emotions of expectant joy.<br /><br />""Like a Ghost in Your Own Life"" is hauntingly familiar and enticing in its carefree melodies and warm almost-not-there vocals.<br /><br />""A Long Way to Fall"" is gorgeous in its simple beginnings and openness. It is like wave after wave of nostalgia. You will be amazed by the feeling of unconditional love flowing through this experience.<br /><br />Then...<br /><br />""I Take Comfort in Your Ignorance"" is a little darker and has more driving beats that give it a European flavor. It feels more layered like Goodbye. If you like more moody music you will like this. This track - I admit - is a bit too much for me and seems a little more indulgent on the beats. I think I prefer when Ulrich keeps a whole album in the same mood. This track is a little startling. :)<br /><br />""A Forgotten Birthday"" is back to a journey to the stars and a more smooth and soft synthesizer sound. My husband brought me flowers right as I was listening to this as if he just remembered something he'd forgotten. Maybe Valentine's Day! This track is such a romantic mood and with the scent of fresh flowers it borders on magnificent. This is one of those tracks where you can saturate in the sounds for an extended period of time and it really helps to release all those happy brain chemicals.<br /><br />""The Weight of Darkening Skies"" has softer beats that turn into an absolute downpour of chaos. But Ulrich always gives you a beautiful payoff when the track melts into bliss. This has a discordance that is very enjoyable.<br /><br />""Borrowed Time"" is otherworldly and yet calming, then goes back to dramatic with a xylophone and creaking trees and almost a music-box mood. You hear a voice but you won't hear the words.<br /><br />""Ten years"" is like a fairytale of mystery at the start with milder melodies and a sense of spaciousness. It feels layered like Goodbye but has some of the initial newness of Ulrich's first albums.<br /><br />""A Ritual in Time and Death"" does initially feel like a funeral, but enlivens and resurrects into a more poignant melody which seems cautionary and then really lets loose into a more expansive sense of consciousness. On AKG K553s this is very interesting at the end as you can hear every sound.<br /><br />This album has darker moodiness and lighter love. A few of the tracks were more intense than I usually prefer, but the melodies are haunting and familiar. These remixes will probably feel that way to you too if you know Ulrich's music and have been listening to it for over 20 years! Has it really been that long? How time flies when you are listening to great music!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FhwoS+FDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FhwoS+FDL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FhwoS+FDL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bQLHgOmcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bQLHgOmcL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bQLHgOmcL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fiU7ABtQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fiU7ABtQL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fiU7ABtQL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B084Q8Z4YP,B084Q8Z4YP,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2023-03-10 02:25:24.885,0,True,"Despite loving the original, I just couldn't get into it"

Anyways, I'm always looking for a CD of music I can listen to while reading a book and I'm reading a book about an Irishman who is in love with a British woman. So it is good mood music for reading at the moment. It is also soul calming and very relaxing to listen to.

3.0,Not their best,"As has been said in other reviews, DR is okay, but not one of TFK's best. One of the aspects that truly makes most of their catalog stand out is an unflagging optimism. &#34;Stardust we are... close to divine...&#34;. On Desolation Rose, that optimism has been replaced with a decidedly gloomier outlook. (Read Stolt's comments in the main description to get a better idea where he's coming from here.) Sorry... I think it's more effective to inspire listeners than the reverse. On top of that, even the music seems thinner here. Gone are the grandiose themes, replaced by more pedestrian music sporting predictable changes and time signatures. It's not that &#34;fiddly bits&#34; are necessarily always better, but after repeated listens, there just isn't much here to hold your attention. Is this better than most of what passes for music on the pop charts? Absolutely, but that isn't saying much. I'll stick with &#34;Stardust We Are&#34;, &#34;Space Revolver&#34; or even &#34;Banks of Eden&#34; for something a little more recent.

4.0,A desert island disc,"A solid record. Gleason started (along with AD co-lead vocalist Warren Ham) as a sideman for John Elefante era Kansas, after which they shared lead vocal duties in Kerry Livgren and Dave Hope ’s short-lived post-Kansas “solo” effort - AD. After that band’s sadly abbreviated life, Gleason released Children of Choices which was produced by (also ex-Kansas) John Elefante and his brother Dino. The Elefantes owned and operated Pakaderm Records as well as one of the most successful studios in Nashville and produced a string of successful CCM releases by artists such as Petra as well as John Elefante’s own solo work and collaborative band Mastedon and others. Their excellent work is also amply demonstrated on CoC. Songwriting is solid and excellent throughout, as are the arrangements and production. If you’re familiar with Gleason’s vocal work with AD, you may be pleasantly surprised by his punchier and more in-your face work here. One can only wonder how AD’s output might have benefitted from the Elefante brothers’ involvement. (Not to denigrate Livgren’s own substantial production skills by any means). Sadly, Gleason’s musical efforts faded away shortly after CoC. He released a small amount of material which apparently suffered from lack of publicity. Nearly thirty years later, Children still stands as a high water mark of 80’s power pop CCM.",[],B0007746GU,B0007746GU,AGZFRAVHZY6FKJ7JUMJ6Y5R7HMHA,2018-09-09 18:05:42.748,2,False,A Classic Study of Near-Death Experiences

Away from the game, it's pretty grating on the ears unless it's at very low volume.  Lots of barky synth brass and crash cymbals (makes it EPIC, right?). Uematsu's work is melody driven and contains motifs for important characters and events so you remember them pretty easily many years later.  This soundtrack has none of that; just try to remember the orchestra music from the movie you just watched 3 days ago and it's the same effect.<br /><br />FF12 is a fun game with great characters but none of the music here reminds me of anything but the cookie cutter symphonic noodling you find in most Western RPGs.

5.0,Back in the spotlight,"What happens with this guy every single time I purchased one of his albums, is that there is always one tune that will linger, and eventually become one so precious, that will more than justify the purchase. Almost like he knows to a science in what part of the album to place it. After his previous, “Does what he wants”, which I felt was an outstanding effort, with such a clean and full sound, and highly creative songs, that I thought to myself that Mr. Matthew Logan Vasquez is truly one of a kind. After watching his band, Delta Spirit, in City Austin Limits for the first time ever, I never was able after that great brief live show, to not keep my ears and eyes glued to this talented musician’s career. He definitely has immensely talented people surrounding him, but alone he is also a powerhouse. This new effort started with a tune a little on the graphic side, as he sings “with her legs around my neck...”, which kind of surprised this listener, such an intimate thing to say, from an otherwise formidable lyrics architect. Not to say that my perhaps prudish comment diminished the beauty of the song itself. Matthew Logan Vasquez, apparently, indeed, does what he wants, and he is definitely as good as they come. Kind of like back to back, with some beauties in there, way better sound than the crappy live show in some small venue in San Diego, years ago with Delta Spirit, where the uncontrolled noise was a disaster, but copious amounts of Johnny Walker shots made it more passable after a while. Now he has a very tight sound, and of course, being musically blessed as he is, the sky has always been the limit for this guy, who definitely has a lot of heart, immersive lyrics coupled with haunting songs, he keeps me on full alert, and to be fair, the show in San Diego was tremendously enjoyed by most in our rather large group, so my hearing loss was well compensated, too demanding, is in my nature. Here is for a truly second to none musician! 4 Stars.<br />4-29-2019 Update: upon further listening I can only say this latest effort is as good as it comes, even my comment a little on the prude side regarding legs around the neck, has vanished in meaning as it actually is much better than initially judged. Matthew Logan Vasquez is every bit a musician to be reckoned with, and like the better tunes one listen do not tell the story with this very talented powerhouse. I must been buzzed but the Oslo song made me shed a tear of joy, and I am not even from Texas! Stay down with your bad self, Matthew (yes, we are on a first name basis, now what!).

Dead Letter Office is quintessential REM from the early years when it was a challenge to understand Michael Stipe's mumbles and the the music had a fresh, raw sound.  Recently, I have been playing DLO in my car and reminiscing.  The mix of covers and original material works well, and this album includes some of my favorite tunes.  I love how REM does Toys in the Attic- it's a worthy tribute though it still maintains the REM feel.

Unlike Eno, he avoids mechanical repetition merely for the sake of experimenting with technology. Rather, you can hear words; lyrics and storytelling laced within the complex nest of harmonics. You sense emotions along with mood swings - highly sophisticated expressions that are poetic and philosophical. If you are new to Inoue, pick up World Receiver or Ambiant Otaku - you will not be disappointed.

If you know that buying independently will cost the same, but you will receive a regular case (which also is stronger) with a complete sleeve, why not doing so? because in this box you get a lot more songs, more remixes, more live version.

5.0,"Excellent quality, anointed, but too few songs","I was not sure what to expect when I popped the CD in the car stereo as I set out for a lengthy trip in my car the other day.  I was pleasantly surprised at what came out of the speakers, however.<br /><br />SWEET SWEET SOUND is an excellent album/CD.  The quality is top notch.  Lots of catchy music, but a deep anointing of peace accompanies each song.  The titles are varied in style, and the approach is refreshing.<br /><br />The lyrics are not all about ME but about appreciating God and His relationship with us.  It is sort of like a little window into private conversations with God that the listener can echo if choosing so.<br /><br />I go by whether the music has an anointing of peach upon it more than skills only and this album definitely does.  I can see it being played to death on KLOVE or other stations which tend toward redundancy, however.  I hope not, because these songs are great and sometimes overplaying takes away appreciation for that.<br /><br />Sarah Reeves' style is like a mix of OUT OF THE GREY, FLEMING & JOHN, SIXPENCE NONE THE RICHER with a twist of the old MARGARET BECKER style in a few songs.<br /><br />This album is way too short, however, only 7 tracks, one of which is a tiny little diddy song that takes so little time, it does not really qualify for a SONG.

There isn't a song in the collection that I don't enjoy listening to.<br /><br />It is amazing how to this day, when I see this cover how it makes me smile and feel happy.<br /><br />The songs are creative, the flow of music in the song lineup works very well with great variety that works well together, and I find it refreshing to listen to when life gets overwhelming and unnecessarily complicated.",[],B0035ECHRM,B0035ECHRM,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,2012-07-25 10:54:24.000,0,False,Kitty's hot on the trail

5.0,This is what sacred music SHOULD sound like,"Christianity has made an indelible imprint on the Western world, and two of its greatest cultural gifts are the art it has inspired and the music.<br />You do not have to share the Christian faith to be moved by this music.  The words, the feelings of joy and loss and redemption, the MUSIC, convey a sense of the sacred.<br />Andrea Bocelli gives a radiant recital of these treasures.  It is music like nothing else he has recorded: it is not pop, it is not purely &quot;classical&quot; (music for music's sake), but music for liturgies, in grand cathedrals lit with multitudes of candles, where there is still a sense of fear and awe of the Divine.  Bocelli conveys a sense of devotion that makes this music feel alive.<br />I am a devoted fan of Bocelli's, and while I imagine that most people who buy this album will listen to it only at Christmas and Easter, I play it often.

4.0,Good recording of little-heard music ...,"Very nice performances, with clean crisp articulation and generally good sound.  My only quibble is with the tempo of the Andrea Gabrieli Magnificat -- it seems a bit too brisk to me, given the space in which it would have been performed and the likely distance between the three choirs in San Marco, an effect which I believe Gloriae Dei Cantores is trying to replicate.  There were times when the sound became ""muddy,"" and a slower tempo would have mitigated that effect.  Some might also argue with doubling the TTBB choir with low brass instruments (with no other doubling in the piece), but that's really a matter of personal taste. Gabrieli would have used whatever he had on hand, so if all he had were sackbuts, sackbuts he would have used.<br /><br />This is a good investment if you're looking for music performed in one of Venice's -- and the world's -- finest cathedrals.",[],B000003XFU,B000003XFU,AHRGTIMQO47C2VLJILIDU53BQKSA,2007-11-27 10:15:50.000,2,True,Sean Duffy solves another unsolvable murder!
5.0,"One of my ""desert island"" recordings ...","It really doesn't get any better than this: the perfect marriage of words, music, and intention.  Add to the mix supremely capable musicians, and you have a potentially life-changing experience.<br /><br />The story of Britten's WAR REQUIEM is well known, so I won't go into that here.  The first performance was marred by the refusal of the USSR to allow Vishnevskaya to travel to England; we had to wait for this recording to hear all the soloists that Britten intended for that first performance.  It was worth the wait (yes, I was alive back then, and remember the event ... )<br /><br />Britten's juxtaposition of the Wilfred Owen anti-war poetry with the traditional Roman Catholic requiem mass text is brilliant.  For example, when the chorus sings ""Sed signifer sanctus Michael repraesentet eas in lucem sanctam: Quam olim Abrahae promisisti, et semini ejus."" (""But let the holy standard-bearer Michael lead them into the holy light as Thou didst promise Abraham and his seed.""), the tenor and baritone (along with the chamber orchestra) respond with Wilfred Owen's ""The Parable of the Old Man and the Young,"" a retelling of the Abraham and Isaac story, with a rather different ending.  As I said, brilliant.<br /><br />I've had the pleasure of singing in the chorus of two different performances of this piece, and it remains one of the highlights of my life.  It's a monumental work to produce, requiring a full orchestra, large chorus, 3 outstanding soloists, a chamber orchestra, a children's chorus, and a harmonium -- you need the space to accommodate all those musicians and still keep everything together.  This recording manages to capture the feeling of the enormity of the event.  Really a first-rate recording.  Highly recommended.",[],B0000041Q5,B0000041Q5,AHRGTIMQO47C2VLJILIDU53BQKSA,2014-05-13 00:11:26.000,5,True,Fun Facts and Mysteries Solved

Mr. Tolk's education includes a B.A. in English literature from Brigham Young University and a degree in law from the University of Utah. He maintains a improbable and fascinating combination of careers as a lawyer and a professional musician, and on top of all that, he is a devoted family man with a wife and three children.<br /><br />In addition to the piano, Mr. Tolk plays the acoustic guitar and synthesizers in the band Big Parade, but he states that the piano is his first love.

5.0,"God bless you, Dave!!","God bless you, Dave! I recently listened to Miles Davis recording of &#34;Solar&#34; and it brought back all the great memories of this remarkable musician.  He used to give me private saxophone lessons while I was in junior and high school (1989 -1994).  What great times we had!  He would come to my house from his humble home on Brighton Beach with his clarinet and give me a lesson for $20!!!  He would write out all the exercises and tunes by hand and also bring me tapes of some of the finest jazz recordings.  We had no set time for lessons: we just kept going until he or I was tired.  He gave me gifts for Christmas and birthdays.  One time he took my $350 Conn alto with a $5 plastic mouthpiece and started playing - and I was absolutely blown away.  It sounded like a $5000 Selmer Mark V.  He was one of the kindest persons I've ever met.  His absolutely favorite phrase was &#34;Time is King!&#34;  If you don't have the right beat you can't play jazz well.  Unfortunately we lost contact once I entered college.<br /> He never told me about this album; I just researched him and found out that he passed away on January 1 (how ironic!!), 1998, and that he made this album.  Despite his brilliant talent, his quiet personality and complete indifference to money prevented him from becoming world-famous.<br />This album is vintage Schildkraut: unparalleled beauty of sound, Bird-like technique, and complete control of the instrument and breath.

4.0,Much better than most cases out there,"We are partial to Otterbox and iFace cases, but when I saw this one, I liked the perforated holes that allow for the phone to cool, so I thought I would give it a try. First, let me say that it is a solid case and I did feel it would protect my phone fairly well. Is it an Otterbox? NO. Is it an iFace with the rubber, shock-absorbing edges? NO. However, it's still a solid case an you can tell it is like the Kate Spade ones where they are for fashion with zero protection. I would say this one provides an average amount of protection. Since screens are so easy to crack, I usually like my cases to come a little bit higher than the screen so it gives it a bit more protection if it lands flat. If coupled with a glass screen cover, you can't get better protection and I have never had a broken phone between using the two. This case doesn't give too much of an additional lip beyond the glass screen, only a slight lift. But, it's still better than a lot of cases I have seen. I would recommend it for average protection on a phone, but would definitely make sure I also had a glass screen cover for a bit of extra protection around the edges.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614D4KqaW5L.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614D4KqaW5L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614D4KqaW5L._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MSlcc8iDL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MSlcc8iDL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MSlcc8iDL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wJ6zoC8RL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wJ6zoC8RL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wJ6zoC8RL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B07X1LY593,B07YQP2XG2,AE2BLXPEH643OUNYUROLEJOHCMWQ,2020-02-09 21:00:40.900,0,False,"Action, intelligent characters set in a new sort of dystopia in the Northwest of Canada"

The aluminum is apparently treated in such a way that the color doesn’t seem to be able to be scratched off, and I have put this case through serious drops.<br />All In all, this reasonably priced case has outperformed cases at much higher price points, and has done so while maintaining it’s form, and with a much more streamlined form.",[],B07RVDNRP4,B09K37SQGZ,AE2BOF5GOOKSTHXH2T3ZK72PSPAQ,2019-12-14 00:43:21.201,0,True,Not like Black Beauty at all.

5.0,convenient phone holder with great hold,"I did not like the fact that I had to put the sticker on the back of my phone. I was skeptical about a magnet being on the back of my phone constantly. Especially with it having to be on the outside of my phone case. My phone case is not smooth, so that concerned me at first.<br />Although, I had issues with putting the magnet on the back of my phone case, it did work out for the best. It does not hinder the function of my phone. It doesn't interfere with me holding my phone just as I did it prior to putting the magnet on there. It doesn't add bulk or anything really out of place. You get used to the magnet being there pretty quickly. It does have great hold on the magnet for the stand. Matter of fact, the hold is so good that you have to put some Force into getting the phone off of it. I generally just slide my phone down from the holder, and that usually does the trick.<br />My only concern with that is if I am weakening the air vent that the holder is clipped to. Over time, I figured that the spot where the holder is is going to fracture and break. Especially due to the fact that I am in such an extreme climate, texas, and that it can get pretty hot in the car. I got this phone holder in the fall, so it has not had to suffer through a Texas heatwave. Only time will tell whether or not this magnetic holder can endure.<br />So far, so good though. I got this upgraded version of the v i c s e e d model after the previous nut and bolt attachment on the clip-in holder cracked. That one I was using during the spring and Summer here in texas. I believe that the joint part that screws in over the ball, cracked due to always being moved and having to hold up a phone , in combination with temperatures going up and down all the time. But, it was also a pretty thin piece of plastic. It was fairly lightweight and hollow. So, this in comparison to the older model, is much better. I do appreciate the opportunity to try this one out versus the older model. I saw this model in an email that I received from the company after I wrote them about the warranty on the older model. They did send me a replacement joint for the clip-in model, but it's more convenient to just have the magnet.<br />I also noticed that if you do not put the circle magnet on your phone almost all the way perfectly on the circle of the stationary magnet, it can slip off and fall. I did that once, and learn my lesson. I had to drive the whole way home with my phone on the floor of my car. If you don't get the phone at least 75% of the way on to the holder, it will not hold.<br /><br />Overall, I am impressed with this holder, alright I initially doubted whether I would like it. Took me about a week to actually decide to use it. Took me about 2 months too decide to use to the old one. But having a phone holder does make it more convenient when driving.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n-pDCWUlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n-pDCWUlL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n-pDCWUlL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0BF54FTNL,B0BVM4P8C7,AE2IXS44ZDWKYFI3RAH5S7OEQW6Q,2022-12-14 01:57:33.629,0,True,"excellent as part of a series, very good on its own"

5.0,Excellent protection for your Pixel phone!,"I had an Otterbox for my first iPhone, an iPhone 4, and I was really impressed by it. My son, who received an identical iPhone and Otterbox, informed me that Otterboxes were for... old people. Slings and arrows! Anyway, my iPhone 4 is still alive and ticking, while his suffered injury after injury until it had to be replaced. My point being that when I recently switched from Apple to Google's Pixel phone, I was very interested in the Otterbox for it.<br /><br />(Please see photo) The Otterbox looks great and does an excellent job of protecting the phone, which is kind of slippery IMHO. It does not come with a screen protector that I could locate. I did manage to make things difficult for myself during installation when I neglected to remove the thin silicon case I had installed on the Pixel. Seriously. I couldn't figure out how to install the Otterbox. Eventually I realized that I had neglected to remove the silicon case I had purchased. Once that was removed, installation was a breeze, fits great, looks great, has &#34;grippy&#34;-type of rubber pads where you want them, the buttons are easily accessible -- totally great. Love this product. I don't want to drop my new phone, which wasn't cheap.<br /><br />So if you can get past having a teenager tell you that Otterboxes are for old people, BUY THIS PRODUCT!

5.0,Great protector Great Service & Support!,"I've long trusted the accessories I receive from Anker. I've had cables, chargers and many other products over the years of having smart phones and their screen protectors really do a great job as well. I recently had purchased this 2pk of the 'Anker GlassGuard Screen Protector for iPhone XR 2018' for both mine and my wife's phones. For just over a year the protectors worked very well and were met with an unfortunate slight crack/failure over the course of the next few months.  I was quite happy that the protector did NOT allow damage to either phone's actual screen which is the purpose, but I was hoping they'd last a little longer.  One of the best parts of the Anker brand is they stand behind their products even for these screen protectors that  generally see a lot of usage with how much we all use our phones and so many chances to bump, drop or scratch no matter how careful we are.  The support team (notably Yvonne) was able to provide a full replacement through their site and quickly communicated and shipped things with simply having to verify the purchase and show the picture of the cracked screen protectors.  I really appreciate the ease of support and the completely reasonable and expected process to provide a new set which we are very happy with. Thanks Anker for having taken great care of this lifelong customer!",[],B07GXDW6LJ,B07GXDW6LJ,AE6FJWLHTPXIMSLMUTF5YXODCRQA,2019-08-05 13:02:23.477,1,True,A great read
2.0,Not really sure yet,I attempted to install the screen cover and I have to say it barely feels like more than those semi rubbery covers you get to take off electronics when you first buy them.  I wouldn't exactly consider them protection other than basic smudge level covers that amount to preventing finger prints.  As I almost got the first one on it was so flimsy it started to fold up like how duct tape does if you let it fold onto itself and then as with the tape it's about ruined and by that point I just threw it away.  I'm not impressed but I will still give them 2 stars for what I'm sure is an ok cover but I guess maybe having 6 to a pkg makes up a little for trial and error getting ONE of them to work right.,[],B07G8VMKQ7,B07G8VMKQ7,AE6FJWLHTPXIMSLMUTF5YXODCRQA,2019-08-19 19:42:02.007,0,True,"Other books are complicated , but not this one for making different types of Sourdough breads."
4.0,Great sturdy stand,"I really like this stand for a number of reasons with one catch. I'm very impressed with its sturdiness and solid frame as well as the angle it holds the device. I like that the cushions are not too sticky and not all over to take away from the look and ability to move it around as needed, but also keep it in place without worrying it might slip. However, the one knock I have is that if you don't have a case on the device, the front part of the holding arms do not appear to have any cushion on them. I think if I didn't have a case and I would be removing the device with any quickness that the screen or whatever side was out at the time would scratch easily. I haven't tried it specifically for good reason, but I have noticed that about every time I remove the device it seems that I'm rubbing/scratching against my case edge and I'd hate for that to be my screen even with a screen cover on it and no edge protection.  Overall I really like it and like any piece of metal in general with a rough surface there's a chance of scratching something else much like how 3000 MacPro's or any Mac/iPad...  aluminum ASUS and so on can scratch in an instance from just about anything else that's slightly rough metal or whatever.

5.0,Not exactly as advertised - durable yes but not completely confident in protection,"The Caseology Legion Violet Case for Galaxy S9 (2018) is a good product but not great.  After having it for about a year, there are a few things I like about it and others not so much.<br /><br />While the case is durable, easy to hold, and enables me to use all the ports, power button, and volume rocker easily, and it also works well with wireless charging, the case does not confidently protect a Galaxy S9.  The photos will show that the screen of the Galaxy S9 phone curves out further than the case can protect, if dropped.<br /><br />The photos also show a Zapp screen protector from before it cracked when the phone was knocked off a shelf approximately 3 feet onto vinyl flooring.  Both the case and the screen protector combined saved the phone and technically did their job.<br /><br />Notice the gap between the display and the screen protector and the case – it is not adequately protected.  That gap is sharp and a dust magnet.  Without the screen protector the case is fair, although it doesn’t account for the few millimeters of the phone screen rising above the edges of the case itself.  If dropped face down, the case will not protect the phone.<br /><br />You can also see in the photos; fingerprints are very easily seen on the color portion of the case that is also not textured enough for confidence with grip while holding the phone.  The SIDES of the case have an adequate grip, however even a light texture added to the back of the case would have been an appropriate addition.<br /><br />My personal experience with this case is that while it is a good product, it is not designed to protect an S9 with the curved screen bulging past the case.  This small discrepancy leaves S9 phones with little to no protection especially if dropped on a hard surface.<br /><br />I have not been able to find an decent screen protector to work with this case.  This could be a design flaw of the phone because when researching cases and screensavers for the Galaxy S9 most everyone has the same complaint about the display of the phone curving toward the edge.<br /><br />My main concern is that this case advertises protection and after having it for nearly a year, I cannot say with 100% certainty this case would be a product I would purchase FOR protection.<br /><br />There will more than likely be a few of you out there who will point out that my phone was protected from the fall and you would be correct as I stated above.  However, a 3 foot drop onto a vinyl floor should not have caused ANY damage to any part of the device or screen protector.  That curved screen is not amply covered to be protected.<br /><br />Caseology is a good product, I have had a few cases prior that have all done the job described, however this is the only model I am not 100% confident to protect my device especially considering it states ""Reinforced Protection"".","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7uiKw5iL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7uiKw5iL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7uiKw5iL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7uiKw5iL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7uiKw5iL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7uiKw5iL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NCtp1MMcL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NCtp1MMcL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NCtp1MMcL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B079K5ZSCF,B079K5ZSCF,AEF52WSZ6A2VTLEHNS44GKIYPOEA,2019-06-07 22:39:45.389,3,True,"Couldn't decide what story it wanted to be - mystery, romance, mid-life angst....not great"

3.0,Nice light easy to use band but shorter than listed.,"Disappointed. This is a single strap. While it is long, about 2 1/2-3"" is a hook material which folds over onto a soft velcro like material. And that feels very secure, if you have small to medium wrist, not a big wrist. It will not  latch, it just pops loose.<br />Which is a shame, they feel nice, lightweight, the band has a little give,  but not bungie cord stretch. Also of note, while the velcro closure is pretty secure and omn its own I don't see it coming lose, the flap could catch on something and come lose. BUT because of the way it is atta he'd chances of the watch coming off your wrist are slim. Just an FYI for active folks, or folks like me who bump their watch while working.<br />I love the newer style pins, so much easier to install.

I have a credit card case on my Samsung S8, which makes it too thick to be held by most holders, but it fits in this cup holder almost just right. I say that, because the edge of my phone case sits right at the edge of this holder's opening. I can push it down hard into the opening, which will push out the flexible front lips a little, and the phone will sit just fine until I slam on the breaks. It is angled well, but I think if it were angled back a little bit more, the phone would be less likely to tip out (again, in its case) in fast-breaking scenarios. The lip is not adjustable; I'm not sure if the leading brand-name cup holder is either. I am going to use a bit of black Suguru that I have on hand to edge the lip so there will be no danger of this happening; that, or I'll just slip a rubber band around the bottom.

It does more than an induction charger I bought for my Apple watch, iPhone, and AirPods. Way more. But that thing is gorgeous.<br /><br />This? 10 feet away at 10 MPH, it's good, but it up close, it's made of lightweight plastic, and the watch stand is not only NOT pre-powered, it doesn't fit the Galaxy Watch charger.<br /><br />In its favor, it's a pretty color, and it works great.

5.0,"It's not you, it's me...","Update 07.11.22: Due to the ""snap on"" outer case, even the corners of this type of protector lift up every time I change my case (which is daily), therefore, the bubbles never disappear and are very unsightly. These are of excellent quality, very strong and solidly secures to the device, it's just the way the outer case snaps on that causes the problem...my search continues.<br /><br />Original review...<br />Because of the way the outer cases snap on, it peels back the pre-installed film screen protector which ruins the edges. I applied this glass protector easily but it's also easy to catch a few pieces of lint underneath (drives me crazy lol) so I had to use the 2nd protector and applied it flawlessly. There were air bubbles on all 4 corners but they are dissipating one at a time. So far, no issues with the corners lifting up when snapping on the front case.

4.0,Needs modifications...,"I  will say these are very similar to the mfg installed front protector which I happened to like. I thought the application process was strange, actually backwards. I do a pretty good job aligning and applying screen protectors in one try w/o lint getting trapped underneath, however, the backside ratio is divided from top to bottom like 60/40 vs the usual 50/50. This forces the application to begin at the bottom then working upwards which I find odd. Also, the bare bones instructions provided are written in poor, broken English which made them difficult to follow resulting in me using two of the three protectors.<br /><br />Once on, the adhesive is great, doesn't interfere with screen sensitivity and it's smooth (all bubbles disappeared within 2 days) but....I'm finding the Z Fold 3 snap on cases aren't made to fit properly with any front protector. I've tried 3-4 different types/brands and this is always the constant issue. So to prevent the corners from being pushed up by the case, I had to trim each of the outer corners with scissors to make room for the case to snap on securely w/o disturbing the protector. It doesn't look bad since it's covered by the case and it did solve the problem but the ideal solution is to make snap on cases to accommodate the protectors. Bottom line, these worked best of the few I've tried, 3 for the price is a good deal and I would repurchase if in need (at this price).",[],B09NCW3Y54,B09NCW3Y54,AEO77PF7QZ6WQOZVVUZMLVGVIW6Q,2022-08-07 07:01:43.438,0,True,"When hungry, we'll eat anything, so why not try a tasty little morsel"

5.0,Amazing viewing with this glass shield,"Supershieldz came as a 2-pack with a cleaning cloth, 2 ""dust absorbers"", 6 ""guide stickers"" and alcohol cleaning wipes. These puppies are not plastic, but glass, so the end result is really fine if the instructions are followed carefully. The difference between having a plastic shield and this shield is astounding. Everything appears so much clearer. I didn't experience the bubbling or odd wrinkle during the easy install. I did use the dust absorber and believe that it helped towards how nice the viewing is. Unfortunately, I didn't figure out what the ""guide stickers"" are for (duh) and they are not actually mentioned in the instructions. Consequently, my shield placement is a little off on one side since I just hovered then lowered the shield down by eyeballing. Don't do that! The shields are adhesive on one side and stick well. Use the guides! I mean, my phone is alright the way it is. The size and shape of the shield conforms perfectly with the 2021 Moto G Play screen. My screen is protected. The shield is just offset slightly because of my placement. It's more an aesthetic thing resulting from my ""operator error.""

He loves it, the price is great, he gets unlimited calls and texts and since he rarely uses data, he is happy as a clam. Me on the other hand, I'm using all, especially data a lot... mint sucks!

Customers service claims my phone might be the issue, it's not, worked great on t-mobile itself?!? They admitted that they are second class on the t-mobile network and get slowed down if there is a lot of use on the network. OK with that price, maybe I have to live with slower speeds, but not with constant timed out searches and loading speeds of multiple minutes. It's ridiculous and I'm very angry that I switched and left my cheap grandfathered in T-mobile plan to save $10 more per month.<br /><br />Soooo if you are a light user with patience and a smaller budget this works... if you are the main person in the household that needs data...

5.0,Fast Wireless Charger Performs Better Than Samsung Wireless Charger,"This ANKER WIRELESS CHARGER WITH POWER ADAPTER (PowerWave II Pad, Qi-Certified 15W Max Fast Wireless Charging Pad) definitely charges my Galaxy S10 cell phone faster than my original, official, Samsung Qi-charging pad.  All I have to do is center my Qi-enabled phone atop the Anker pad, and the charging begins.<br /><br />The Anker charging pad has a small blue light on the front that lights up when the pad is actively charging.  As long as you center your phone sideways on the Anker pad, you can easily see the light.  The charger is noiseless.  (Like all wireless chargers, this one charges more slowly than a phone cable connected directly to an AC outlet.)<br /><br />If you have a Galaxy S10 phone, you don’t even need a light on your wireless charging pad.  The phone’s display tells you everything you need to know about the charging status--whether the phone is charging, how much charge is currently in your phone, and how much time remains before the phone is fully charged.  When the phone is 100% charged, the display tells you that as well.<br /><br />Anker products have a good reputation for quality and reliability.  All of the Anker products that I’ve actually tried (mostly power banks and backup batteries) have lived up to that reputation.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711RrWNcjdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711RrWNcjdL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711RrWNcjdL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B083B9HB6Q,B083B9HB6Q,AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q,2020-03-08 21:30:04.841,1,False,"great writer, grreat book"

My Samsung Galaxy S10 phone recognizes it as a “fast charger” when it is plugged into my Honda Accord’s accessory power socket, and it seems to charge the phone quite fast.<br /><br />Both cables work.  Both cables have USB Type C plugs--the reversible oval kind that are used by newer Galaxy phones.  The blue light around the rim of the charger tells you it is connected.  The light also makes it easier to see the ports on the plugged-in charger, if your car’s accessory power socket is in a dark space like the Accord’s pocket or console.<br /><br />Note that this is a “Cluvox” car charger, not a “name brand” car charger, so the quality may not be as good as you might get from a more expensive charger purchased from a cell phone manufacturer or seller (e.g., Samsung, Verizon).

I’m unwilling to plug in a device that has a voltmeter, when the function of the voltmeter is NOT explained in the accompanying literature.<br /><br />I’m also turned off by the array of power on/off switches for the adapter and the individual sockets.  Presumably the device won’t drain my car battery if they’re all turned off, but who knows?  (Again, there’s nothing about car battery drainage in the instructions.)<br /><br />Even if the switches turn everything off that’s able to drain the battery, there’s no way that I won’t forget and leave one or more turned on some time when I turn off the car’s ignition.  For me to use a device like this, I need for the device to turn off automatically with the ignition.<br /><br />In the end, I don’t really need a bunch of extra accessory power sockets in my car.

However, my Apple Pencil wouldn’t work with my iPads, because it refused to pair with them properly.

5.0,Essential Accessory,"Because of certain changes in my life – I do tend to run my iPhone down quite a bit. So, using a car charger is a no-brainer.

The charger is a bit “rough” to plug into the car, but once it’s in? It isn’t easy to get out.<br /><br />The cord is durable. I mean REALLY durable.

5.0,Best Hands Free Tool!,"Since I started using a “smartphone” (my HTC Evo in 2011) – I’ve wanted something like this. But, I’d keep upgrading my phone and tech would change.<br /><br />I went from the Evo (it fell to its demise) to a Samsung GS3, the GS4, GS8, to now an iPhone 11 (as of December 2020). So, I’ve used ALL kinds of phones. And, I am one of those people who really dislikes buying all kinds of “phone-specific” tech gadgets. I want something that works for just about everything.<br /><br />I saw this, and for about $18 – this is PERFECTION!<br /><br />There are no instructions in the box, the product page has them, and if you have a smart phone – easy to access.<br /><br />Me? I’m kind of “figure it out on my own” type. It took less than three (3) minutes to get the mount and ball/socket joint attached, and less than three (3) minutes to mount it to the vent on my car. Easy to put the phone in and secure as well as remove. Also, the design allows for a car charger as well. I am using a simple (but sturdy) case for my phone. I will update if my standard “OtterBox” type hampers this.<br /><br />In the mount, it gives enough view of the camera to capture any pictures or videos on the road, so your phone can double as a dash-cam.<br /><br />I’m absolutely delighted with this. And, yes … like all “vent” mounts, it does limit the operation of a vent’s up/down motion. The side to side? Not so much.<br /><br />The car I use it in is my 2008 Chevy Cobalt.<br /><br />SAFETY NOTE:  The road pic is a screencap from a video that was STARTED BEFORE the car went into motion.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510+iwpyhOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510+iwpyhOL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510+iwpyhOL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eJQ-VtwaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eJQ-VtwaL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eJQ-VtwaL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0BJBKL6SG,B0BJBKL6SG,AF4P6A3SEKS2HCISWAKFZVIFM7NQ,2023-02-20 05:04:05.197,0,False,Another great Scheinberg coloring book!

After a week the rubbery stuff along the edges started to peel off, but that was mostly cosmetic, annoying but livable. Then the camera cover cracked, because the back of the phone isn’t thick enough so it is what hits stuff first. Sigh. Fine, I’ll make sure to flip my phone on its face and at least it was only the protector.<br /><br />But my final issue is that I’ve had it for just around 2 months, and the leather around the camera is coming completely detached.<br /><br />I had a phone protector much like this for my last phone for a year or more… and I didn’t have a single problem with it, it’s not like I’m really hard on my phones.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L44ZsymiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L44ZsymiL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L44ZsymiL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zwGNgpUPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zwGNgpUPL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zwGNgpUPL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B09DC3HM4Q,B09DC3TTPH,AF4VOOEMVOVPMYCECKREIKMPKPSA,2022-01-01 01:13:09.845,1,True,A good starting point to planning a France road trip.

The volume on the phone though isn't great and that was my only negative. I like to play music at work off my phone and it wasn't very loud, so that was disappointing. If you've got headphones in then it's fine, but I can't always use headphones.<br /><br />The other day my phone slipped out of my hand and dropped on the sidewalk.

If I can't find anyone, then I'll ship it to a Nokia care center and get it fixed. I guess I should have bought the added protection plan from Amazon.<br /><br />Update: I sent my phone to the Nokia care center and they fixed my shattered screen and sent my phone back in no time!

3.0,"Phone isn't steady, but a good alternative to the vent clip phone holders","I wanted to replace my current cellphone holder that clips onto the air vent because I can't enjoy heat through those vents when I have my phone clipped. I figured this phone holder would be the solution since it's attached to the rearview mirror.<br />The piece itself seems pretty sturdy, I didn't feel like I needed to be very careful with it when I went to clip it onto the back of my rearview mirror.  Set up is very easy, after adjusting the width to fit the mirror, just squeeze the back tabs on each side together, and clip it on. After that, I shorted the front latches so that the holder was secured tightly to my mirror.<br />My phone clips on easily, and I like that I can pull it down or up and rotate it. What I don't like is that the extension that holds my phone shakes when I'm driving.  If my car didn't have bluetooth hookup and I couldn't use my gps on there, I would probably return this because there is no way I would be able to follow my gps on my phone if it was attached to this phone holder, because the screen gets waaay too shaky and unreadable when I'm driving on the highway.<br />Verdict: For the price, it's alright.  Would I go out of my way to purchase this again if this one ever needs to be replaced?  No.  I only plan to use this holder until the end of the winter, and then I'll be going back to my tried and true ac vent clip magnetic phone holder.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KTvhO4HlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KTvhO4HlL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KTvhO4HlL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0B58ZVBDB,B0B58ZVBDB,AFAQZ732NOPHGMU3OMFA2VXILXQA,2023-01-17 06:29:02.656,0,False,This book was a hit!
5.0,First Stress-Free Installation- EVER!,"I cannot tell you how happy I am with this screen protector.  I always dreaded putting screen protectors on, because of dust getting under, or not being able to line it up correctly, etc.  But this otter box screen protector took care of everything.  It comes with a microfiber clot and screen wipes- just like any other good screen protector, but the difference with this one is the installation box that it's in.  Whoever designed this needs a raise, because this made the installation SO easy!  The box adjusts to the size of your phone, and you just drop it in.  I cleaned the screen with the wipes and the cloth, removed the protector on the screen protector that is attached to the box, and just lowered it down over the phone, and it snapped into place!<br />Never have I ever installed a screen protector in one go.  I've always had to lift it up once or twice (or even three times more- which at that point I've given up and have decided to live with the dust under the protector), because of dust or because I didn't position it correctly.<br />The screen is clear, and there are no issues at all with the touch screen with this protector. I love that it blocks blue light.<br /><br />This protector is absolutely worth its higher price in my opinion. The fact alone that it rids you of the stress of installing is worth it to me.  Time will tell how durable the protector is.  I tend to have to repurchase screen protectors every 2-3 months from me cracking them because I always drop my phone.

I found this one in a news story from Tech Watch and thought if it was good enough for Apple to use with their display models, that had to be positive. I am so happy that I bought this.<br /><br />The pen really does work with this model of IPad. The device even recognizes it as an Apple Pencil. The touch screen sensitivity is amazing and the palm rejection feature works beautifully, allowing you to rest your hand naturally on the screen to write and draw as you normally would on paper.<br /><br />The pen is very easy to set up, light and portable and not all that uncomfortable to use. I like the shape, as it ensures that it doesn’t roll off the desk or other surface when you set it down. The tip is durable and yet doesn’t scratch the front screen of the device, which, I must admit I was worried about with the previous pen I bought.<br /><br />The battery life is pretty good and will let you write or draw for a good number of hours before it needs recharging, which you can do with the lightning cable that comes with the IPad. The top of the pen is connected so you don’t lose it and it doesn’t require you to do anything special to begin using the pen right away. The writing is smooth and you can read your handwriting when you are done writing, a vast improvement over the last pen I tried. There is very little screen lag time and so it feels really natural to use this pen.<br /><br />Overall, for the price, I think this was a great investment. You can also get replacement tips directly from Logitech, 3 in a pack for a reasonable price for when the tip begins to wear down. I am super impressed with this pen. I’d definitely recommend it to other shoppers looking for something that is just as functional as the Apple Pencil, with half the price tag.",[],B07JFP5G4L,B0C54JDKFG,AFDNLNTANUGENK62RSTAQALJOWPQ,2019-07-07 15:13:42.521,6,True,"Geared toward readers familiar with sailing, interesting learning curve experience"
2.0,Not what it claims to be,"This pen is deceptively nice looking and well packaged. Unfortunately, the palm rejection features on it are absolutely non-existent, and it writes terribly. The device does not recognize it as an apple pencil, so it does not work well at all with the newer Ipad, which in the description it claimed that it did. The writing is terribly inaccurate with awful skips and hit and miss jotting the rest of the time. I could actually write better with a 25 cent stylus than this thing, which, for the price, did not impress me at all.

5.0,I don't think you'll find a better screen protector for the Galaxy Note II,"This is a 5-star product.  To start with, the instructions are excellent.

Between the written and video instructions, you'll have a flawless bubble-free installation.  Perhaps best of all, the end of the instructions say something like: &#34;Don't worry if it doesn't turn out right. Call us and we'll try to help in any way we can.  And this product has a lifetime guarantee, so we'll send you another set of screen protectors if you mess up the first batch.&#34;  What else can you ask for?

I wanted something big, fast and compatible for my eyes when mounted on my scooter for GPS and Waze. The size of this phone's screen was perfect. In no way was I going to spend $1000 for a phone. Only morons are stupid enough to do that.<br />The TCL was less than half the cost of my Huawei. I'm glad I took a chance on it. I couldn't believe the enhancements that had occurred over 2 years. The TCL is quick, responsive and has an excellent screen. The fingerprint and facial recognition systems work great and it does everything I want it to do perfectly.

5.0,Holds Your Phone Firmly in Place,"Cell phones are great for many reasons and while we know we shouldn’t use them while we drive, sometimes, we must do this, like when opening up a map and trying to follow it. To be safe, a phone mount is essential, and a good choice is this cell phone mount, made by Tronwin.<br /><br />My greatest problem with cell phone mounts is that they tend to not hold themselves in place. This is my number one demand when I purchase a cell phone mount for a car: It must be the type that clips on or otherwise grips in a way that it won’t fall off. Mounts that use suction cups are the worst. Clip on are best and this mount scores highly in this area. It clips to the air vent, and it holds firmly in place.<br /><br />This cell phone mount can hold just about any cell phone, regardless of its size. You just push the button to move the sides out, place your phone between, and the squeeze together. To release your phone, just push the button in the back once again. You can pull the base down, too, if necessary to make your phone fit.<br /><br />Another cool thing about this cell phone mount is that it can be moved around most any way you like. Other mounts will come loose if you try to move them too much. But with this mount, it can be moved to just the right angle. You can even turn it sideways, if you prefer to view your cell phone that way.<br /><br />Cell phones are a regular part of life. This cell phone mount from Tronwin is an excellent choice for all the reasons stated above. It stays secure and offers extra movement not possible with other mounts.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mfwPwHQzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mfwPwHQzL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mfwPwHQzL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WmF3IwPTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WmF3IwPTL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WmF3IwPTL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B09H64HDCR,B0B1ZBDRR3,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2022-01-02 16:39:24.694,1,False,Left me feeling like I was witnessing ugly gossip mongering.
5.0,Fast Charging Ability,"It can never hurt to have more charging cords available. With so many electronics in my home, we are always looking for charging cords and we often misplace them. To keep the iPad going strong, I decided to get this Galvanox PPS GaN Charger.<br /><br />This charge is like most others. The cord itself is detachable from the head of the plug, which means you can leave the head inserted into a socket, unplug the cord itself, and use it elsewhere. We often do this when we charge electronics in the car.<br /><br />You do get reasonably fast charging with this cord. With our ipad, it charges it at the rate of about 2 to 3 percent per minute, which is more than fast enough to meet our charging needs. I tend to leave charging cords plugged in, but if you need to unplug and store, just roll it up and place it in a drawer until your next use.<br /><br />With the proliferation of electronics, it is important to have the means to change readily available. This Galvanox Charger is quite good at its intended task and it earns an easy recommendation from me.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51l6cuLSD2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51l6cuLSD2L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51l6cuLSD2L._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0BS56TG2V,B0BS56TG2V,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2023-01-29 15:52:09.574,0,False,"Colorful, fun word and sentence builder"
4.0,Keeps Electronics Organized,"There never seems to be enough charging cords in my house. They get moved, placed in drawers, and otherwise misplaced right when we need them. It’s good to have the right cord for the specific electronic and a cord that cannot get lost, while also keeping things organized when you have a large number of devices to charge and this is where a charging station like this one can help.<br /><br />The best feature of this charging station is that it includes cords to accommodate different electronics, and that includes apple and Samsung. It takes a little assembly effort to get it ready, but once you’re finished, the slots are ready to handle your different electronics. The apple and usb cords make it efficient in this manner.<br /><br />This charging station does seem to charge a little faster than using our usual cords, so that is a plus. If you happen to live where power surges are commonplace, I recommend plugging it into a surge strip. It’s best not to take chances, especially if you have a large number of items plugged in.<br /><br />I like what I have experienced with this charging station. The only issue I have with the slots is that some electronics are too tall to fit. My ipad is one such item. Other than this annoyance, this charging station from Catlyn is good for households with varied electronics, since it helps charge many different devices at once and keeps things organized.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fqzioGKeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fqzioGKeL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fqzioGKeL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0BPXZWCBG,B0BPY47SY6,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2023-02-10 19:34:35.202,0,False,Great Book

4.0,Mostly good,"As of this writing, only the black case was available on Amazon so I purchased the red one direct through Supcase.  I've been loyal to this brand for years and they've protected my devices from what I thought was sure destruction more times than I can remember.<br /><br />This is my first edge case, however, and my first impressions are good, but not great.  The clear back looks sharp but I question its durability.  I also have camera protectors put on and while they fit through the opening, my phone no longer lays flat as it did with the case I had on while waiting for this one to arrive.  Not a deal breaker but I wish the camera protectors, which do not add bulk, were flush to this case's backing.<br /><br />Finally, I had to remove the fingerprint ""dot"" on the inside of the screen protector for two reasons: the first being that it was touch and go with whether or not it worked; secondly (and the ultimate reason I peeled it off) the dot was too visible, impeding my viewing experience.  The dot was completely transparent but its edges let me know it was there at all times, which was very distracting.<br /><br />All in all, I love the frame of the supcases as well as its screen protectors compared to the peel-n-stick ones that come with competitor brands.  I'm going to give this one a try but I may go back to the original style that has nontranspant back plate if I feel this one's durability isn't up to the task.

4.0,Tempered glass screen protectors are what I prefer over the plastic types.,"I have numerous phone protectors that I have gone thru. Actually a few of us in the house do. We all buy the same phones for the most part. Only one kid has a different one. This makes it much easier for cords, helping each other and for putting on new phone protectors. Life is just a tad simpler when we can just go to the cell phone box of goodies and extras. No one has to worry that it will be the wrong part, cord or screen protector.

As they are a thinner plastic, once stepped on they would most likely be done for.<br />• For under $10, this set of six is reasonably priced.  The quality meets the price point.<br />Overall, these will work for my kids when their hands are busy, and they want to watch a video or such.

It came with a screen cover but for now I’m using it without it.<br /><br />It has a slightly “gritty-hard rubber” feel to the case. The built in stand nicely positions the phone either vertically or horizontally but is a little prone to tipping over while it’s in the vertical position if your not careful.

5.0,"Strong Suction Cup, Easy to Adjust","I selected this windshield mount to hold a GPS navigator as the suction cup that came with the navigator is weak and has a bad tendency to let go unexpectedly. So far it is working well for me, though admittedly I have not had it very long so there hasn’t been a lot of wear and tear on it yet.<br /><br />The main feature of this mount is definitely the suction cup. It’s super-sticky and it holds even when the temperature outside drops below freezing. Most regular suction cups have a bad tendency to lose suction and release when it gets cold, usually at the most inconvenient of times. I don’t know how cold it has to get before this one will let go, but it’s definitely a lower temperature than a typical dry suction cup.<br /><br />The bracket that holds the phone (or in my case the GPS) is designed to be worked with one hand and it works well. It opens easily and snaps closed when a phone is pressed into the bracket. The problem I have had with other brackets like this one is that the foam grips on the brackets have come out and get lost; hopefully this one will not have the same issue, and so far it hasn’t been a problem.<br /><br />I like the versatility in adjustments that can be made to get the position right. The arm telescopes out and the height can be positioned just right to either get it out of the way or to put it precisely where it needs to be so it’s easily accessible. A word of caution, though – when mounting to the windshield, take care to put the suction cup exactly where you want it, because once it’s placed it takes some deliberate effort to move it again. Typical suction cups are much easier to move and often can be shifted with one hand; don’t try that with this mount. The only additional adjustment that would make this mount even better would be to have the base on a swivel so the mount can be easily turned. I haven’t seen any mounts like that so far.<br /><br />So far I’m happy with this mount. It seems to be holding up well and the suction cup is nice and strong. It’s a bit difficult to move once it is mounted though this is one of its strengths. It has other adjustments that make is versatile enough to have limited movement once attached, and getting your device in and out of it is easy. This is easy to recommend based on my experience with it so far.",[],B07HD4HWNT,B07HD4HWNT,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2019-01-01 10:31:02.397,6,False,An Urgent Call for a Deeper Commitment to Christ
4.0,"Good Lens, Clip is Passable","I have worked with a number of lenses for phones and I have seen some interesting variations. Some require a special case to work with a phone (and therefore are model-specific) while others use a special clip that clamps over the phone’s lens. This one falls into the latter design type and for what it is it’s very good, though there is room for a little improvement.<br /><br />There are two main components to this lens. There is the clip to which the lens attaches, and there is the lens itself which is actually a pair of lenses. The clip is a solid and sturdy thing with a strong grip so I will not slip off the phone when in use, a problem I have seen with lenses of this type on occasion. The part that touches the back of the phone has a thin foam pad that provides grip, and the pad has a slight swivel action to it so in theory it will lay flat regardless of the phone’s shape. It works in that regard, even with the phone case on.<br /><br />Now, that said, to get this lens to really work I have to take my phone out of its case. That’s inconvenient but not a deal breaker for me because my phone case is a simple slip-on case. For those using a more complex case it may prove to be more tedious. There are things that could have been done to make it fit regardless of the case.<br /><br />The lens itself is a two-piece assembly, as many are. When assembled it is a wide-angle lens that enhances the field of view in the shot, especially when zoomed out. When only the base is used, it is a high-magnification macro lens that is great for taking clear pics of things that are very close. In both cases, I have found the images to come out with very little distortion and the images are clear and sharp. For the macro lens test I used my thumb as a test subject and I was able to get good ridge detail on my thumb print.<br /><br />The lens includes a nice cloth bag that keeps it clean and protects it from scratches. It’s not much protection against crush damage when the lens is stored in a book bag but it’s certainly better than nothing and will keep the lens mostly pristine when on the go.<br /><br />This is a good lens, let down by a basic clamp that could have been better. If you don’t mind taking your phone out of the case to use this lens, the lens will serve you well and you’ll be rewarded with solid, clear pics.",[],B07L3PKGCS,B07L3PKGCS,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2019-02-02 12:41:01.058,0,False,Life Is Filled With Possibilities - How To Embrace Uncertainty
5.0,Work as Expected,"With a couple of iPhones in the house I am always trying to track down lightning cables. I selected these in the hopes that they would be a viable alternative to buying Apple-branded cables. My concern with these cables is that the listing says nothing about MFi certification, so there is no guarantee that the cables will work properly. As it turns out, they work just fine, and the colors make the different cables easy to tell apart (for those of us that have color preferences).<br /><br />Without any indication of certification, I wasn’t sure if these cables would work at all, though most uncertified cables I have seen and used have at least permitted the phone to be charged. Only one way to find out – I plugged my phone into my computer using one of the cables. My phone immediately started charging and my computer was able to access the storage in my phone. That’s really all there is to it, they work.<br /><br />The cable is shielded in a nylon weave and is terminated on both ends with a hard plastic plug with a sleeve before capping in an aluminum casing. They seem to be made well and hopefully should last a while.<br /><br />The price is good, too, considerably cheaper than Apple-branded cables.<br /><br />So far, I have no complaints with these cables. They work like they’re supposed to work in spite of no certification statement, they’re inexpensive and they seem to be made well.",[],B07P71NT21,B07P71NT21,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2019-04-05 01:06:37.179,1,False,The Most Fun and Enjoyable Book You Will Ever Read!

5.0,Works Well,"I have worked with a number of power banks like this one, and all of them are similar in concept and basic function though they vary in capacity, number of ports, included accessories like carabiners and other features. This is one of the larger-capacity packs with which I have worked and so far I have not had any issues with it. It appears to be a solid workhorse.<br /><br />At the heart of any of these battery packs is a set of rechargeable batteries, which is where these things get their weight. Generally speaking, the heavier the power bank the more batteries and more capacity the bank possesses. This one is no exception to that. At a capacity of 25,000 mA, this is a bit of a brute and has some heft to it. That said, it is slightly smaller and lighter than most of the higher-capacity units I have used.<br /><br />It’s a handsome fellow and looks quite a bit like a smart phone.<br /><br />There are two output ports for charging USB devices. One of them is rated for 5V/1A and the other is at 5V/2.1A. This does not mean that when you plug in a tablet or phone that it will steadily output a full 1A or 2.1A. Putting a USB power meter on the ports when charging my phone on the 1A port, the power fluctuates, especially if I am actually doing things on my phone at the time. When “at rest”, my phone typically draws about 0.5A, but when I open an app or open a web page in the browser, it spikes and will pull quite a bit more but then it settles again.<br /><br />I have not drained this pack completely yet so I am not sure how many charges I can get with it when it comes to my phone. My phone can be charged from dead to 100% on a pack that has a 2,500 mA capacity, so in theory this one should be capable of giving me 10 full charges between needing to be recharged itself. We’ll see. It does get my phone charged up relatively quickly, and it shows its own capacity while it is charging so I’ll know when it is getting low.<br /><br />So far, I have no complaints with this battery pack and I am pleased with it. It looks nice, it has a very high capacity and it works as advertised.",[],B07PFMJ3XG,B07PFMJ3XG,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2019-04-10 08:06:13.342,0,False,Read This Excellent Book to Increase in Wisdom and Knowledge!
5.0,Exceeded My Expectations,"I have used a number of different phone holders of different types, but this is the first one I have used that is mounted on the air vent. I have avoided this type of holder up to this point because I did not trust that they would hold well or would constantly force the vent to point downward from the weight of the holder. Summer is upon us, and I have had repeated problems with my phone overheating and shutting down so I decided to try this holder to see if it would help with that problem specifically. Now I wish I had been using this type of holder all along; it has proven to be far and away better than I expected.<br /><br />I will start by saying that my concerns with this type of holder seem to be unfounded. The holder does keep the vent open which is ok, and there is a little bit of play in the vent itself in terms of being able to move the fins, but the holder stays put and when attached properly it holds securely.<br /><br />Most spring-loaded holders with which I have worked use a spring to clamp closed on the devices they hold, but this one works in the opposite way. To close, the clamp must be manually closed and squeezed against the phone to secure the phone, and the button on the holder causes the clamp to pop open. This isn't a problem, it's just different than what I have seen before now.<br /><br />So, with the temperature close to 100 F in the car, I clamped the phone in place and cranked up the AC. I made two important observations. First, the holder was not as disruptive to air flow as I had thought it would be. Yes, it does block a good bit of air from direct flow but it does not close the vent or keep air from flowing, so it did not impact how well the car's AC worked. Second, even with the sun beating down on the phone, the phone was cooled enough by the AC to be cool to the touch and it never shut down on me.<br /><br />This phone holder solved an important issue for me and cleared up some of the misunderstandings I had about air vent mounts. It works well for me and it allows me to keep my phone alive when other solutions failed me. This is an easy product to recommend based on my experience with it.",[],B07SN3DKSV,B0C2PCFMKB,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2019-07-18 10:56:19.635,0,False,Some great ideas
5.0,Works Well and Competitively Priced,"I selected this phone mounting system specifically because it comes with a vent mount and I have had problems with my phone getting too hot on the dashboard. The one I had been using broke and could not be repaired so I needed a new one, and this one seemed like a reasonable solution. So far, I am very pleased with it. It seems to be well-made and it holds the phone very well. The cost is a plus as well.<br /><br />There are two ways to mount your phone with this unit – either using the suction mount or with the ventilation mount. Most people will probably use the suction mount, and as far as that goes the suction mount is better than many I have used. The suction cup itself is one of the sticky types that gives it additional adhesion to smooth surfaces, a huge plus when mounting on the windshield. Because of the stickiness, it is a lot less likely to release when the window gets cold in the wintertime. The vent mount is very typical and is a basic pincer mechanism that uses a wingnut/screw to tighten. The good news is that you don’t have to choose just one or the other because the ball and socket connector allows for moving the actual harness between the two. So, if you have two vehicles, you only need one unit without needing to move the whole thing and you can leave the suction cup in place.<br /><br />The harness itself works like a standard car mount solution – drop in the phone and squeeze the sides together against the phone. Press a button to make it let go of the phone. Adjust the bottom support bracket for larger phones. This is not rocket science. What is different, though, is that the release is more of a soft mechanism instead of an abrupt open that slams immediately to completely open. When the release button is pressed the harness opens gently. That will reduce stress and wear, though I never had a problem with any harness breaking in the past because of this.<br /><br />I put the phone in the harness, closed the harness snugly and then inverted the whole thing and shook it very vigorously. The phone didn’t come out and didn’t even wiggle. That’s a very good sign that the harness won’t accidentally let your phone fall if secured properly. While not a road/vibration test, it is more than enough to make the point that this harness will keep your phone secure.<br /><br />Finally, there’s the cost. I have seen a lot of harnesses that are of lower quality that cost more and don’t come with the ventilation mount. This one is priced competitively.<br /><br />So far I have zero complaints. I am not a typical user in that I favor the ventilation mount, though the suction mount is well made and will keep your phone secured. The harness is above average and does a very good job of holding the phone in place. And finally, the asking price is very reasonable.",[],B088WZ6588,B0C57J2P19,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2020-07-18 17:23:45.107,9,False,Love this Penn Cage Series (Greg Iles)
5.0,Solid Vent-Based Mounting System,"I go through phone mounts for the car at a rate of about one every year. My preference in mounts is actually vent mounts because the AC coming out of the vent keeps the phone cooler (I have had problems with the phone overheating in the car on occasion and mounting over the vent helps tremendously). I have used other Andobil phone mounts and looked to this one to fill the need since my last mount broke. So far I’m pleased with it.<br /><br />This mount is a typical ball/socket mount for the vent, but there are two different vent attachments for it. One is a typical pincer-type that grips via rubber-padded fins that work somewhat like disk brakes. The other is a type I have never before seen and works by a retractable hook designed to hold tight against the back of the vent fin, without a friction grip.<br /><br />The pincer grip works about as expected. It has a wingnut-style tightener that slowly closes the fins together until they form a good, firm grip on one of the fins in the vent. If you haven’t worked with this type of mount, I offer a word of caution from experience – do not overtighten, because enough tension will cause the fins to crack and break which ruins the mount.<br /><br />The other mount works on a worm gear style of mechanism (if it’s not a worm gear, it works like one). A turning sleeve slowly retracts the hooked arm until it catches and holds snugly against the vent. It has a couple of splayed feet that provide support against either the rest of the vent or the dashboard depending on how it is positioned.<br /><br />From experience with other Andobil mounts, I would recommend putting a drop of lubricating oil on the ball to help prevent the socket from seizing. The rubber gasket in the socket has a tendency to stick to the ball, which is an issue if you want to make an adjustment to the position.<br /><br />The holding bracket for the phone itself is well designed. Some brackets snap open abruptly when opened, but this one opens gently which produces less wear and tear on the inner workings. It accommodates my phone just fine (an older iPhone 6) but it also is large enough to handle larger models without difficulty. The bracket holds securely and I have had no problem with my phone shifting or slipping, even when I have slapped my phone in hastily without paying attention.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice vent mount for the phone. It holds well and it has a different mounting mechanism that seems to work better than the normal pincer type, though it comes with a pincer mount too if that is preferred. If you like vent mounts for the phone (and in my case, such is my very best option), this is one to consider.",[],B08SWLYYSL,B08SWLYYSL,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2021-05-08 13:37:53.746,0,False,Entertaining book about the entertainment industry
4.0,High Capacity at a Great Price Point; Slow to Replenish,"I use battery packs like this one to charge my phone all the time; I’ve learned that plugging my phone into the wall and letting it charge continuously shortens the battery life, while a battery pack cuts off when the charge is finished. This is the highest capacity charger I have seen and used and so far I am happy with it, though I do have one complaint with it.<br /><br />Most packs I have used top out around 10,000mA (some have been higher) and are good enough to charge my phone 3-4 times before needing to be plugged in to replenish. This one is 30,000mA and I believe I can get around 10-12 charges from it before I need to plug it in and charge it back up. That’s a huge difference. I say “believe” because I have not drained it all the way to nothing yet, but so far that seems to be about right.<br /><br />This thing has a good-sized solar cell and it helps in keeping the charge up. That said, do not expect it to charge at the same rate via solar cell as it does when it’s plugged in. On average I have noticed most solar packs take roughly 4 times longer to charge with just solar as compared to using USB.<br /><br />This unit plugs in via USB-C for charging and this is faster than using MicroUSB. Now that said, this is not a fast-charging device, at least when replenishing the pack. When I received it I immediately plugged it in and it showed it was roughly half charged. It took several hours to reach full capacity. Using the port to charge a tablet the charge speed it fine, though. Being a larger pack it will obviously take longer to charge up than a smaller one, but I was surprised at how long the charge takes, considering the USB-C charging port. Fortunately I have not needed to charge it from empty yet.<br /><br />Included is an LED flashlight bank that is good for emergency use. I don’t make a habit of using such, but it’s a nice-to-have.<br /><br />One word of caution I offer if you have used other cells like this one – this one is heavier than is typical, which is a function of the capacity due to bigger battery storage. If traveling light is more important than having battery power, this is something to keep in mind. The include carabiner is very helpful and allows for clipping this pack to a backpack, belt or other otherwise unused loop or hook.<br /><br />The price is the big bonus with this pack. I have seen packs that cost more that have less features and less capacity, so this pack is a bargain considering the price point.<br /><br />Other than the slow recharge, this is a great pack that will see a lot of use in my house. I love the capacity and I like that I can leave it on the window sill to keep charging when not in use. The price point is excellent, considering the capacity. If you need capacity and the weight isn’t a concern, this is one to definitely consider.",[],B08YRQ5WLG,B08YRQ5WLG,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2021-05-27 11:41:51.668,0,False,Many beautiful lines come from a young man
5.0,Solid Basic Phone Case,"It has been a while since I have had an Otterbox phone case. I recently upgraded my phone and wanted a basic clear case for it, and I chose this one. So far I am happy with it.<br /><br />This is a basic, no-frills case for the iPhone 13. As mentioned I chose the clear case and it is very much that - it is not frosted or opaque like another case I have but is absolutely clear.<br /><br />The case is designed for bumper shocks more than anything and it delivers. It has a thick, semi-pliable bumper guard as well as a fair amount of thickness on the back so your phone is well protected. It does a good job with medium height drops and fumbles and it keeps the phone for getting scratched up when jammed in a pocket of briefcase.<br /><br />The button covers work well and the phone is as operable as if I put no case on it at all. I have had no issues with unresponsive buttons related to this case. The speaker, microphone and lightning ports all line up nicely on the bottom as well and the case does not interfere with any of these. Finally, the case comes to the perimeter of the screen but does not actually touch the screen so it does not interfere with screen covers - I major issue I have seen with a few cheap cases in the past.<br /><br />I am pleased with this case and expect to get years of service from it.

5.0,Decent Flap Case for iPhone 13,"I had a case similar to this one for my iPhone 6 and I really came to appreciate it. It was convenient to have the necessary cards with my phone without having to carry a separate wallet. I wanted a similar case for my iPhone 13 and I found this one. It's not perfect but it answers the need I have and I am happy with it.<br /><br />This is a basic flap case with three card holder and one ID holder. It does add a little bulk to the phone when the phone is in it, but it still fits nicely in my pocket. Contact magnets keep the flap closed so nothing shakes loose.<br /><br />One of the features this case claims is RFID protection. I decided to test that on the card readers at work, which are very sensitive and can read my badge from over a foot away. With my badge in this case the reader could still scan it, but it had to be about 2"" from the sensor before it would pick up. That's on par with the large majority of RFID wallets I have tried. I have seen better, but I have also seen worse. For most people, this is sufficient protection for preventing scans from any practical distance.<br /><br />The case seems to be made well and I haven't noticed any problems with the material separating or being assembled incorrectly. Time will tell how well it holds up.<br /><br />The one area where I think this case could use some improvement is in the number of card pockets. It can hold only a total of 4 credit cards (or 3 + 1 ID card). That may be enough for some, but I need a couple more slots. Adding more would cause the case to add much more bulk, and the flap would not close either, so this is probably as close to perfect as I will find.<br /><br />As I write this, the asking price is about $20, which is reasonable.<br /><br />This is the type of phone case I wanted and it meets the need I have. It looks nice, it holds a few cards for me so I don't need to pack a separate wallet, and it offers basic RFID protection for those cards. The asking price is reasonable too.

5.0,Really nice wallet case but unfortunately can't use QI charger unless I take my cards out,"I had previously been using an otter box wallet case for all of my phones up until the S 20, however the version for the S 20 had terrible reviews that the S 20 kept falling out of it. Thus, I was suddenly in the market for a new type of wallet case.<br /><br />This has a different form factor that I am used to, with the cards on the back of the phone, and I wasn't convinced at the beginning that my cards would stay put. However, after testing this for a solid month, they have stayed put and I've been really impressed. The phone has a nice protective ridge around the front so that when I drop my phone, it has some level of protection. And the case is easy to hold, fits around my phone perfectly, and has presented no issues, except for the QI charging.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the cards are placed in such a way that if I have my ID and an ATM card in the slots as directed, I can't QI charge. This leads to me removing my cards and then forgetting them, which is exactly what I don't want and the whole point of having a wallet case for me.<br /><br />However, when I use a cord to charge and just leave my cards in there, this is a really comfortable, ideal case that is pleasant to use. I like that the sides have a grippy texture that means that sweaty fingers are unlikely to drop the phone, and the overall form factor is quite nice. Definitely the cardholders are very effective and it's easy to get what I need out of the slots, without them falling out when I don't want that.<br /><br />Overall this is a nicely designed case for people who use a cord to charge.",[],B083L9MFMD,B084J4WJ1P,AFPF2CONJ33FNFKOEQ2TUNWQJTFQ,2020-09-25 16:11:56.163,0,False,Good book for vintage penmanship instruction

I've waited about half a year now and even my cell phone company is telling me to get rid of this phone. Calls drop and often I can't make calls because I am out of range, whatever that means - never happened with cheaper phones! The only way out of that is to turn it off and on again. I've had to contact my cell phone company three times now to reset the phone, which involves me removing the sim card, and turning it off while they do that from their end. When I asked how to avoid doing this, they said buy a new phone. How disappointing!!! I would not recommend this phone for that reason, for not making calls (see above), for not being loud enough for voicemails, for saying that my contacts to call do not exist when they do, for calls not going through -they dial and hang up. It's SO frustrating. I didn't get insurance, so, I am screwed and need to keep the phone, but it's sooo frustrating!

He had a stroke that left him with limited use of his left hand, so it is hard for him to hold his phone long enough to watch videos.<br /><br />First off, know that this is made of incredibly cheap, thin plastic. All of the mfg money must have been put into the magnifier screen. It feels like it will fall apart at any moment.<br /><br />But the actual magnification screen actually works very well. It turns a small phone screen into a screen about the size visually of a portable dvd player.<br /><br />My husband had a lot of trouble getting his phone to stay in place with the thin plastic flap on the tray part. He got around this by using a different metal phone holder (also purchased on Amazon) to hold his phone in place and moving the screen in front of it.<br /><br />In my opinion, they have a good thing going with this screen magnifier, but it could be very good if they used thicker plastic on the rest of the unit.

This became available and I jumped at the chance. The biggest issue is the weight, this is over 8 ounces, half the weight of the tablet. It really bulks  up your lightweight table badly and that's disappointing. But it does a decent job of protecting the tablet. The case has magnets which turn the tablet on and off as you open it. Problem there is the way the case configures it covers the rear camera port so they put in a creased corner you can flop down and use the camera with the cover back. This corner also has magnets in it. They should have been left out of this section because it's so floppy it won't stay closed so it's constantly turning the table on and off as the case gets moved around.

I think it really makes the watch stand out on my wrist.  The silicone is soft with a satin finish that is comfortable against my skin.<br /><br />This band has many nice features.  The soft silicone, as I said, is comfortable and flexible.  The clasp mechanism is a quick release that lets you take of the watch very easily.  To adjust the length of the band, there is a little lock on the clasp that allows you to adjust the band, then close the lock and the band stays in place.  This means that the band is infinitely adjustable so that you can get the perfect fit.  The clasp mechanism is magnetic, which is fine for the most part.  Magnets make is easy to clasp and unclasp the watch.<br /><br />So here's the big problem with this band:  The magnetic clasp.  While it is very convenient, it does come off.  I haven't had any issues with it coming apart during day-to-day use, but when I'm active (playing tennis), I do find that it comes apart.  Being silicone, this really should be considered a sports band and if the thing comes apart while playing sports, it kinda defeats the purpose.  I'll probably need to have a little velcro band or rubber band to keep the clasp closed when I play sports.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SSAfCXdAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SSAfCXdAL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SSAfCXdAL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eO6Dl6jDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eO6Dl6jDL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eO6Dl6jDL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vcYEu47dL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vcYEu47dL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vcYEu47dL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0BG4LY5PQ,B0BG4MDS5L,AFXAMSEN6MT4WQHSXCV4JRGXWODA,2022-11-18 22:38:49.445,0,False,"Small town, big secrets. 3 to 3.5 stars"
5.0,A slim iPhone 14 case with a silky feel and a built in ring/holder,"[[VIDEOID:66092c961c39bff86f0c9349a84e5066]] When it comes to phone protection, I strike a balance between bulkiness and protection.  I opt for a slim case to keep the phone small, then I add a tempered glass screen protector for the front and it generally protects my phone well enough.  Including protection from falls and scratches.<br /><br />Thomo Compatible with iPhone 14 Case is just the kind of case that I like.  It is slim at perhaps 1/8 inch thickness all around, made from silicone and lined with a soft felt so there's no danger of scratching the phone while taking it on/off.<br /><br />The silicone case itself has a silky texture that gives it a high-end feel and the color isn't well-represented in my pictures is a nice, dark maroon.<br /><br />Add to this, the built-in ring that I usually have to add to my phones to give me better grip so that there's even less chance for me to drop it.  Of course, the ring also serves as a kickstand for video watching.<br /><br />Now while most cases just come in a box, Thomo tried to set themselves apart by including a nice letter with little blurbs written by various people in their company.  It's a nice touch that gives the impression that they care.  The included sticker is nice too.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Yql84S-cL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Yql84S-cL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Yql84S-cL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hu9rPjevL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hu9rPjevL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hu9rPjevL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0B3RHW35R,B0BYCD42J8,AFXAMSEN6MT4WQHSXCV4JRGXWODA,2023-01-05 16:45:07.673,1,False,"Everyone is of value, & our elders have wisdom to offer"

4.0,Highly responsive stylus for notebooks or touch screens; comes w/4 tips,"At the current price of $11.99 plus 10% off, I think this is a good deal.<br /><br />This works on my LG Notebook, iPad, Google Nexus 7, and Samsung Galaxy Tab. The only one it is a bit touchy on is my LG Notebook as I have to press harder on that screen. On the other three devices all stylus tips are extremely responsive. The only negative is that to get to the pen or the clear tip, one has to unscrew the chamber. Other than this, I love this better than a previous stylus I was using.<br /><br />On the interior of the cylinder is a ballpoint pen and a clear disk tip. On either end of the exterior, is a rubber tip and fiber mesh tip. One replacement tip for each of the four types is provided (see plastic bag in photos 1 & 2). Based on my tests, I do not feel one tip is better over the other. I was able to work with all of them. I personally prefer the rubber or fiber tips over the clear one but none have perfect precision (see last photo). They are just all good enough for what I need this for.<br /><br />In addition to the extra set of tips, it also comes with a fake leather sleeve. Overall, I really like this stylus.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FhMDU82jL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FhMDU82jL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FhMDU82jL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L0JlTlVvL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L0JlTlVvL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L0JlTlVvL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Z6cQEfgPL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Z6cQEfgPL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Z6cQEfgPL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/911x7kGraUL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/911x7kGraUL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/911x7kGraUL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B07S6NJX66,B07S7QMTGM,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,2019-08-23 23:43:42.196,0,False,Great for non-Jews

5.0,Definitely a great buy,I actually wasn’t going to buy it because it’s rather pricey but after buying 3 smaller ones and having to charge them constantly for one charge to my phone I finally splurged after a friend of mine recommended it. I love it! The charge lasts forever and I can charge my phone at least 3 times without having to charge it back up. It’s heavier than what I’d like but honestly that doesn’t bother me. I’d buy it again but I don’t think I’ll have to. Seems like it’s going to last a long time. My only complaint is that the charging cords are a little short so that I have to hold the phone and the charger at a weird angle or it seems the cord won’t last long. Would be better if they were a little longer so that they could bend and give more leeway for the phone.

I'm not sure if that is something that can be fixed in future versions, but as it is, it is not very noticeable, especially when the phone is in a case, and having a tempered glass screen protector makes me feel less worried about the screen. The trade-off for protection is worth it, and I don't think any other tempered glass protector would be any better.

5.0,Solid peformer and full featured for an entry level smart phone,"I purchased this phone on a two year contract direct from Verizon so am going to focus on the phone without commenting on price, which here is different from the deal that I received.<br /><br />I have had bad experiences with HTC in the past and have been more of a Samsung fan. However, this phone has exceeded my expectations. While I love the Samsung's Note series and have gone through the 2, 3 and 4, this phone is surprisingly close. The difference is the user interface and battery life. The interface is subjective, but the battery life is not in the same league as the Samsung Note 4. On the other hand, this phone has the same solid signal reception as the Samsung, and is every bit as intuitive to use.<br /><br />The screen is easy to read, and photos and video are decent (although not spectacular). Considering that this is more of an entry level phone, however, it is truly packed with features and is fast with web browsing and other network functions. While this is not super quick with games, for regular use it is plenty fast.<br /><br />I added a 32GB SD card, which more than compensated for the relatively small phone's internal memory, and person who I added to my plan and who is using this phone is thrilled.<br /><br />If you are looking for a full featured smartphone at an entry level price, this one - direct from Verizon - is a decent and solid phone that is easy to use.

5.0,"Will support a Note 4 in an Otterbox Defender case, but read my caveats","I received this as a free review sample. The reason for five [solid] stars is this tiny holder firmly supports my Note 4 phone and its bulky [[ASIN:B00NF4SXSO OtterBox Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Case Defender Series]]. I would never thought!<br /><br />The holder was easily affixed to my 2014 Outlander's vent and did not budge either. I will say that this will probably not work well during the winter in areas where it actually gets cold and the heater is blasting because phones, and especially batteries have an inherent hatred of heat. Take that into consideration when making a purchase decision. Where I live we use air conditioning almost year round, with some exceptions, so for most of the time this will work perfectly as a phone mount.<br /><br />Another thing to take into consideration: you can orient your phone from portrait to landscape, or any angle in between, but it cannot be tilted. In some vehicles that may be an impediment. Finally, I have not been using this long enough to determine of the powerful magnet is going to cause problems with my Note 4's S-pen, but will caution you to also take that into consideration.<br /><br />Bottom line: if this style of holder works for you, it's a safe bet that it will support your phone in most case types.",[],B01ARQPLMS,B01ARQPLMS,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-04-03 03:57:47.000,0,False,A Rare Find
5.0,Well made and perfect for cutting invasive bamboo stands,"I received these as a free review sample. Instead of beating around the bush I'll get to the reason why I gave it five stars: it will cut through bamboo, and not just shoots, but six-to-eight footers that are nearly an inch in diameter. That alone makes me love this because large areas of my property has become home to invasive bamboo that a neighbor planted and has taken over my yard as well as others in the neighborhood.<br /><br />These shears will cut through new bamboo up to eight feet tall with little effort. The operative word is 'new' because dead stands that are brown require a saw. These will also cut through brush and shrubs as fast and much easier than the other shears and trimmers I own, including long handle pruning shears.<br /><br />A final reason why I rated these so highly is the construction is first rate. I did notice a slight wobble where the pinned handles met, but the blade still seated perfectly into the channel in the opposite handle, and after using these for a full day the shears were still rock solid.  The handles are also nicely designed and easy to grip and operate for long periods - especially when cutting bamboo.<br /><br />Overall, these are well made and do a better job than other shears that I own or have used. Are they the best? Perhaps, but I cannot say for sure. I will say that they are perfect for my needs, and if I were to lose then I would not hesitate to replace them.",[],B01CP0N2LG,B01CP0N2LG,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-04-21 05:27:15.000,0,False,A Positive Message
4.0,"Poor person's iPhone 6 plus - older technology, but fast, functional and good if you are on a budget","I received this as a free review sample. My subtracted star is because the documentation is too small to adequately read. I am a fairly technical user who did not really need it, but for a non-technical person the mere act of finding the SIM slots, identifying which one to use, and how to insert the SIM card is daunting with the existing documentation. A large, single-sheet and well illustrated page would have gone a long way to making this a five star, consumer-friendly phone.<br /><br />Note: this is two versions of Android behind, but for me that is not a real issue. I am not sure if there is an upgrade path, but I do think that the KitKat version (4.4.2) that is on the phone is plenty functional for most people. The big surprise is how fast this phone is. I have been testing it for about a week with a T-Mobile card, and for web browsing where WiFi is available it is pretty close to my Note 4. YouTube video streaming is as smooth as it is on my Note 4, and other apps are just as fast. Bear in mind that I do not use apps that require fast processors, so if you are into game apps this phone may not be what you want.<br /><br />The camera for both photos and videos is pretty close to that on my Note 4 as well. The big difference between this and my [much more expensive] Note 4 is the Samsung can go a lot longer between battery charges. This phone is still decent in that area, but is nothing like the Note 4, so if you are a heavy user this aspect may be disappointing.<br /><br />Test calls were very clear in my area. I am in Central Florida and the area has excellent coverage for all of the major providers. Again, I would rate this as about on par with my Note 4 for making and receiving phone calls, but that is not exactly apples-to-apples since my Note 4 is on Verizon's 4G network and this phone is currently using T-Mobile's GSM service.<br /><br />This phone will accept micro SD cards up to 64GB, which does not completely meet my personal needs, but is probably more than enough for most people. The only other real issue other than the documentation shortcoming I mentioned above is the charging port on the phone requires a charging cable with a longer than normal micro USB end. The cable that ships with this phone has that end. If you want a spare, you can find cables that have that type of end, such as the [[ASIN:B00O7KPVEO Cellet Extra Long 8mm Tip Micro USB Charging/Data Sync Male Cable]].  I recommend purchasing one of those also.<br /><br />Basically this is a budget-priced smart phone that is approximately the same size as an iPhone 6 plus or Samsung Note series. It does not have the latest and greatest operating system or other features, but is still pretty fast and functional. For basic calling, web browsing, social networking and the such it is a great solution. For power users or folks who need (or want) the latest and greatest, this is probably not what you want.",[],B0123MHMZI,B0123MHMZI,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-06-15 12:33:14.000,1,False,A Travel Adventure For Those Who Love to Live Vicariously

I've been using this for a few days (alternating among other compression socks from a different brand.) This pair is as effective as the other brand in managing swelling in my left leg from a trauma, but is vastly more comfortable.<br /><br />What I love about these versus the other is the way it breathes.

Do note the product specs on this page because these are a blend of merino wool and synthetics.<br /><br />The compression aspect is equal to the other socks I use.

5.0,"Only works with vehicles with 3.5mm AUX ports, but also works with most home stereo gear","I received mine as a free review sample. Note: if you are purchasing this for a vehicle the sound system must have a 3.5mm AUX port for this receiver to work. Many older vehicles do not have that port. If your vehicle lacks one, a better solution would be a bluetooth receiver that connects to your vehicle system using an FM radio signal.<br /><br />This is not limited to vehicle use. I am using mine to add bluetooth capability to a [[ASIN:B0077AMSNI Samson Expedition XP150 150-Watt Portable PA]], which has a 3.5mm input channel. I power this unit from a regular 1A USB power supply like those that come with most phones and tablets.<br /><br />Pairing and connecting from my Note 4 phone or Samsung tablet are easy. This goes into pairing mode when powered on, and I have not had any issues streaming music and backing tracks through it. I normally do not use the hands-free function, but I did test it and incoming and outgoing calls are clear and noise free.<br /><br />Bottom line: in my opinion, this is not as ideal as the FM solution I mentioned above for vehicles because of the need for a 3.5mm AUX port. However, for home stereo and on stage connections, this is perfect because even if your PA, amp or received only has RCA inputs, you can connect this device to them using an adapter such as [[ASIN:B000I23TTE C&E 30S1-01260 2 x RCA Male, 1 x 3.5mm Stereo Female, Y-Cable 6-Inch Gold Plated Connector]] or directly into the unit's AUX jack it it has one.

If you are folding bills it will hold about five comfortably.<br /><br />The exterior provides good padding front and back if you accidentally drop your phone, and the holder into which you snap your phone adds a little more protection.<br /><br />My rating is mainly based on value for money. At the Verizon store where I purchased the phone a plain, bumper type holder was priced at nearly four times what this cost. Considering that those cases go for a few bucks here or other online sellers it's plain to see the value in this case.<br /><br />I did not rate this for durability because I have only had it for a week, but I am guessing that it will easily outlast the phone itself which (in my experience) dies before the contract runs out because of failures in fixed batteries.",[],B07SFVNV9G,B07SFVNV9G,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2019-12-01 17:18:16.341,0,True,"Funny, good tips, totally worth reading!"

Yes, I have a screen saver but the case in which the phone sits is not very protective and my screen saver cracked.  I have a condition where I cannot control when my hands opens up, therefore I had to already put a new screen saver on my phone.  Otherwise the case is pretty.

The leather is holding up too and not peeling off like in somebodies else review. The leather now feels really nice since I broke it in. I like the case more than I did in the beginning. Yes, it does not turn off the phone when you close the case, but my phone once it's still for a few seconds will turn off.

5.0,LG G4 case is a perfect fit and it's attractive,"I recently had my LG G4 repaired and decided to purchase a new case for the phone with its new innards.  This is superior to my previous case in fit, durability and attractive color combination,  Included is a screen protective sheet and concise instructions for putting the case onto the phone.  In order to get a proper fit and save the case, be sure to remove the hard plastic shell from the flexible case.  Move the little flaps at the bottom a few times to get them used to being moved and then slip it onto your phone.  Now snap the harder shell onto the phone, clicking it into the fitted spots and be sure the flaps are accessible.  I've had no problems opening and closing them to insert my charging cable or earphone miniplug and they are securely protected when I snap the flaps into the case.  A nice feature is the protection this affords to the slots which naturally have a tendency to develop a dust or dirt accumulation.  The colors of the actual case are more minty green than the yellow green of the image I see online.  The light teal is a pretty complement.  Since the LG G4 is a thinner style phone, this case does detract from its design but protecting the phone is more important to me and even with the case, its thinner than most others.  All openings are well beveled and the phone operates perfectly.  It's quite a bargain, too, since the phone is now an older and less desirable model.",[],B00X0X32P4,B00X0X32P4,AGCA64OUVM2TJGNN3IUXMEU7KF6Q,2019-09-20 19:15:25.501,0,True,Behind the scenes look at real life

5.0,Worked but took an hour to install,Overall very happy with the end result. If you hate puzzles don’t do it. I love puzzles and it worked for me. Took a lot of concentration and attention to detail and about an hour! The YouTube video helped a ton with installing the new screen. Highly recommend using a how to video when replacing your screen. The tools and supplies they provided were adequate. I did use additional tools from my home to successfully installed a new screen. My screws on the inside of the iPhone were stuck and I had to use an X-Acto knife to get them to come out. The glass Screen for the iPhone was beautiful and worked great.

5.0,Ah...home again.  :),"I like a belt-mounted horizontal carry for my phone (I can't understand people carrying these heavy things around in their pockets and, it seems to me, increasing the risk of droppage at the same time) and I found Reiko pouches years ago when they were faux leather and I had...an iPhone 4, I think? Don't remember for sure which model it was. But it was quite some time ago. I loved the Reiko's ease-of-use; with its magnetic closure and the opening in the bottom for pushing my phone up and out of the pouch, using it quickly became instinctive, reflexive - I didn't have to think about it a bit. Sheathing and unsheathing my phone was like a martial arts maneuver one has practiced endlessly (wax on, wax off!) to the point where one executes it naturally, with zero thought or effort. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the faux leather started to give up the ghost, flaking and peeling after what seemed to me not long enough a time.<br /><br />Probably partly because of this...*ahem*...flaky behavior, when I bought my iPhone XS Max I decided to consider other options, and I found the Otterbox Defender series. I came to love that, with its rotating belt clip (I could get my horizontal carry) and the ridiculous toughness of the case. Plus the case was made of a slightly soft synthetic rubber that was extremely grippy, thereby all but eliminating any fears I had of dropping my phone. (I'm not one of these people who treat their phones carelessly; when I buy a new phone I take it out of the box and put it straight into a protective case and don't take it out again for any appreciable period of time until it's time to deactivate it and sell it or trade it in, at which point the new owner gets a phone in brand-new condition and I get the most value possible from my sale or trade.)<br /><br />Anywaysss...I digress. A little. I think.<br /><br />When I bought my new iPhone 13 Pro Max, I jumped on here and went straight for the Otterbox Defender for that phone model...and read the reviews. And learned that Otterbox's quality has gone down quite a ways in the scant few years I had my XS Max, and the holster no longer holds the case securely. That being a total deal-breaker for me, I went looking for a new case and found the Smartish Gripzilla. Not quite as grippy as the old Defender case, but I think it'll prove grippy enough. And while it's less protective for it than the Defender, I think I'm going to like not having to claw open little rubber doors to flip my silence switch and plug in my Lightning cable. But!: no holster. And that's when I remembered my old flame, Reiko.<br /><br />Came back here, found the appropriate size, and pulled the proverbial trigger, and I'm very pleased with what I've received. All the features I loved back in the day - the magnetic closure, the ease of use (and the good looks) are here, and the ""feature"" I didn't love as much - the faux leather material with too short a useful lifespan - is gone, replaced with a woven nylon kind of material that I'm betting is going to wear much better than the old fake leather did. Joy!<br /><br />If you're looking for a belt holster with a horizontal carry, I do recommend these Reikos. Very nice products.<br /><br />Enjoy!",[],B099NWNDY6,B099NX3S5Q,AGCIK7B4BXDHQE3FAQ5JMIDJMKDA,2021-11-27 19:13:13.331,0,True,Fun and sweet
5.0,"Depends how you define ""grippy""","This case is serving me well. I came from an OtterBox Defender case that I had on my iPhone XS Max, which set a pretty high bar for grippiness. This case is not grippy in the soft, rubbery way that the Defender was, but it is textured and shaped in such a way as to make it about as grippy as it could be while still being made out of the material it's made out of. And speaking of the material it's made out of, I fully expect that, because it's harder than the Defender case, it's going to hold up better than the Defender did. OtterBox struck a certain balance between durability and the soft kind of grippiness I was looking for when I bought this case, and the Defender did an outstanding job for a long time, but one day it just suddenly started giving up the ghost – I'd handle my phone and come away with black stuff all over my hands because the case was disintegrating. I'm thinking that what this case foregoes in soft rubberiness it will make up for in durability. The increased hardness probably also translates into greater shock to the phone if it's dropped, but iPhones can handle a lot (and I almost never drop my phone) so I'm not overly worried about that.<br /><br />All in all I think this is probably a solid choice for an iPhone case and I expect it will hold up and protect my phone very well.<br /><br />*Update, 14 months in* - I've grown very much accustomed to this case and its hardness, and it has protected my phone (I think I've dropped my phone once in these past 14 months). It looks nice in a simple kind of way, and is comfortable in the hand, with its little indentations for your fingers. Every indication I've gotten so far is that this case will last for at least as long as I have my phone, however long that may be: as yet it shows no sign of any kind of degradation, whether dent or ding or just sort of disintegrating like the OtterBox cases eventually did. I'm thinking that, even with its hard feel in the hand, this is the perfect phone case.",[],B097QCGNN7,B0BGZ94M8G,AGCIK7B4BXDHQE3FAQ5JMIDJMKDA,2021-12-24 18:16:45.201,1,True,Food Porn with humor

The side functions are easy to use. It is easy to grasp.<br />I've had other Otterbox cases over the years from different series and this one appears to protect as well as the bulkier cases. I haven't dropped it yet so can't be 💯 sure on that point.<br />By mistake with my last phone, it was left behind on a table when we went out. I came back to the phone having been mauled by my dog. He chewed the case corners really well, cracked the glass on the front and back. Thankfully he was not able to chew thru the case and actually eat/swallow any glass.

It's definitely on par with other MVNOs such as Mint Mobile, both in coverage and data speed.<br />This makes a great month of service to have as a spare line for someone traveling, visiting from another country, or just to try out a switch and see if you like it to save some money.

5.0,Initial impression is positive...looking forward to seeing how it holds up,"I’ve had this for 2 months and just finally installed it (I kept procrastinating because I know how time consuming and sometimes frustrating it can be to correctly install a screen protector).  I must say that at least initially, I’m impressed with the attention to detail made in creating this product and the installation process.  I’ve never had a screen protector this complicated to install, but if you take your time, it seems like the results are definitely worth it.  They really thought through everything thoroughly, from the bubble level to the weight that goes over the fingerprint sensor.  My protector looks smooth as glass, and the fingerprint sensor seems to work fine, although I was initially worried that no amount of pressure would get it to read (turns out you’re better off not trying to press your entire fingerprint on the screen when registering it).<br /><br />The plastic film that comes pre-installed on the S10 was starting to look like crap on my device (sort of defeats the purpose of having a gorilla glass screen when you have a very easily scratched plastic protector on there).  Time will tell how this holds up, but my previous experience with glass protectors saving my actual screen from near-certain scratches has been good.  I expect this to be the same but will update my review if I find otherwise.  I’m just really glad they figured out a way to add a protector to a curved screen without having to use cheap plastic film.",[],B07QD2Y4YB,B07QD2Y4YB,AGFLIHRH53IVBPABMQH5TIO5WMYQ,2019-10-12 01:44:08.244,3,True,"Devoured it every chance I had.

I had a case but no screen protector.  So I got the screen repaired.  I searched for glass screen protectors.  I tried a few.  They just didn't work well.<br />During my searches I found this complete encasing phone protector here on Amazon.  I feel that it works well.  It's clear screen is just fine.  Clear.  Doesn't hinder touch screen functions.  The case has 2 flappy covers for the power & head phone jack.  I'm on the fence for trimming these off.  They're annoying when dealing with your phone in the car because the access requires plucking open these covers.  Note: the head phone jack opening of the case only allows for the narrowest plugs.  Meaning that if you have audio cords to connect your phone to a stereo or car, only the skinny designed plugs fit the case opening.  Cords that have the nice metal screw on covers are too large to fit & the plug won't make connection to your phone.  I have not dropped my phone so I have no experience about how well the case protects your phone.  So far, I am satisfied.

5.0,Classy Meets Efficient - Love genuine leather's durability & style,"I am not sure that I can say enough good things about this case. It is absolutely perfect in my opinion. Real leather is tough and rustic. The clasp and hardware is well done, sturdy, unlike the simulated leather case I had previously that fell apart. When you open the case, there is a perfect spot for your license or a photo and card slots. The phone holder fits the phone perfectly secure and all buttons are accessible. It is also easy to remove if you do need to, without damaging the case. You can tuck some items behind the cards as well, you could even include a thin set of checks, if you happen to still use those. My favorite part is the hidden card slots on the outside pocket. I keep my debit and credit cards tucked here for added security. There are card slots on BOTH sides of this leather pull out piece. If I could find a negative to include, I guess I would say that sometimes a scratch shows up on the leather, but that's leather and to me, this is the charm and classic rustic appeal that I go for even in my cowgirl & biker boots! One last thing, I also bought another product from this seller. I decided to swap out the item for a different one.... the seller was fa-nominal with my pain in the rear request. I was delighted.

4.0,I like it,I really like these Body Armor covers. I'm all about the otterbox but I have an iPhone 3GS and have had the pink otterbox on my phone for a year now. Truly I just wanted something different but protective so I decided to try the Body Armor  version of the defender case by Otterbox. So far so good. I've dropped it a few times and it has protected my phone. One complaint I do have is the screen cover that comes with it is a piece of crap!! It's cloudy and super scratched and it is a new one. I did not buy a used one.  But I must say that with my otterbox I had to rip off the screen cover after about 5 months because it scratched and was hard to see my screen with it on. I recently bought 2 more of these cases just for a change up every once in awhile. Also the colors shown are not at all what you get. The green looked light green online but is neon green and the blue looked aqua and it is a basic blue but they are still nice colors.

Inside the envelope were antistatic cloths, which are new to me, and the microfiber cloths to clean off hand oils and dirt. There were 3 protectors that fit the external screen which is critical because the belt-clip type holders for these new Etalk phones are a snug fit with a stiff frame. Pulling the phone from within the too deep holder will wear this outside screen. This product has a perfect fit and is thicker than the material that was stuck to the phone for shipping from the manufacturer. It was easy to install with the 1 and 2 peel away method. There are dust removal stickers included also. They work great as a pet hair stuck to the film adhesive just as I was pressing it to the surface of the exterior glass. The size of the exterior screen cover is 1mm smaller all the way around he perimeter of the screen, but is of thicker quality than the packaging film.<br />There are also 3 internal screen protectors. I was extremely pleased to find that the hole cut for the ear speaker was perfectly placed. This has to be the easiest set of screen protectors I have installed over the past 18 years.

I've had it on my phone a week and already been complimented on it twice.<br /><br />For function I consider a case to serve one purpose - protecting the phone when dropped. This case doesn't pretend to be a heavy duty case and I didn't expect it to be, which is frankly the only reason it gets a full 4 stars instead of 3. I don't feel it's fair to fault it for being what it claims to be - a pretty dress. It just barely fits on the S20 FE, so much so that I can see a thin line of the colored edge of the phone on the top and bottom lips of the case. Though somehow, the corners are not quite customized enough to the phone shape to avoid the case causing lift on the corners of my screen protector. I also don't believe any of the raised edges are raised enough  or designed well enough to do any protecting.<br /><br />On the positives with function - the buttons are very responsive. The corner embellishments will very likely protect the phone more than traditional fashion-only cases, so I think you could classify this case as ""fashion plus"", in that it did add some protective aspects onto a traditionally fashion-only case.<br /><br />I will be keeping it on my phone and being more careful than I normally would with a tougher case.",[],B08NSSB3H1,B08NSSB3H1,AGQDLBPCYRCSEHP2E5TNVHWUOXRA,2020-12-17 12:25:27.322,2,True,No cohesive thread from story to story.

5.0,Fits iPhone Xs Max In A Pelican Shield Mil-Spec Case,"I housed my iPhone Xs Max in what was tested to be the most protective armored case available -- the Pelican Shield iPhone XS Max Case with Kevlar brand fibers (Black).<br /><br />Problem is, it's now Yuge.<br /><br />The Pelican comes with a plastic clip-on belt holster, but the clip broke and the clip holder is really uncomfortable to wear -- the belt clip bites into my skin -- and it's clumsy to insert the phone into. My shirt often is clipped to the holder with the phone, requiring me to take the phone out, pull my shirt away and reinsert the phone.

The phone slips into its plush-lined leather outer case like it was born there.<br /><br />The leather outer case is MUCH more comfortable to wear -- no digging into my side. But, best of all, the phone is easy to pull out and return to its case.<br /><br />We'll see how durable the belt clip and loops are. Right now, I'm using the leather-covered clip, not the loops. But should the clip fail, I'll still have the belt loops as backup.<br /><br />Thanks, Yuzihan, for designing and delivering a belt holster large enough to hold an armored phone.

5.0,SUPERB! If you take the time to do it right. Fits my 15.6 Yoga 730 PERFECTLY.,"I am a perfectionist. I probably spent 20 minutes cleaning and wiping my screen before I even got out the stickers and tape. Why have a bunch of dust on it to begin with?<br /><br />PRODUCT PROS & CON<br />- The front side has plastic handles which make alignment a snap. Also useful if you need to pull up the screen to release a bubble. (Slowly and carefully so you don't break it.)<br />- Fits my screen perfectly very nearly edge to edge. Maybe 1-2 mm difference on the sides. The camera cutout isn't quite centered over the lens, but it's close enough. I tested, and it does not interfere with the camera at all.<br />- Perfectly clear and smooth!<br />- Works great with my Active Pen 2. Maybe even better than without it. IMPRESSED!<br />- ONE con: For a screen this size, there should be more, larger stickers to remove dust. But scotch tape also works well.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL TIPS:<br />- Kimtech delicate task wipers leave no residue and are as close to dustless as paper wipes can be. I use them for my glasses.<br />- Good old clear scotch tape is great for picking up dust, especially around the edges of the screen.<br />- I'm running a HEPA air purifier on turbo to reduce dust in the air. Obviously not necessary, but it reduces dust landing on the screen or protector while your work.<br />- I also check the protector itself for dust after I remove the film in case any static effect draws dust to it.<br />- Work deliberately but not too slowly because dust from the air may settle if you dally.<br />- Use the plastic handles on the front to position perfectly. I worked with the screen upside down and the camera toward me and lined up with the camera then slowly lowered the protector flat.<br />- Run finger from bottom to top of the screen and be patient as seals outward. Leave it alone. Do not help it. If you get any big bubbles, use the handle to pull it back up and the squeegee thing to press them out. Really much easier to lift the screen, but be careful because you don’t want to break it.<br />- I had ZERO dust, so I was done at this point. If you have any dust, you can also lift it up again by the handles and use the dust stickers or scotch tape to remove the dust. But be careful you don't add more dust or fingerprints or break the protector.<br /><br />SUPERB!

My phone just faces the floor no matter what I try. I may as well just keep my phone on my lap for navigation. I hate this one. It stays in the CD player well which is the only good thing about it. My other one (different brand and more expensive) didn’t stay in the CD player as well. But that was manageable. It only came off when we tried to take our phones off the mount. So we have to be careful how we remove our phones. Other than that it is great. That one I can position however I need so I can see my navigation while I’m driving.

It is comfortable to hold but absolutely not squishy or soft.

On my device it is a rich blood-like color that looks absolutely stunning.<br /><br />Okay - so why am I disappointed?  Smudges! It is not smudge resistant.

3.0,Glitzy case with limited  protection,"[[VIDEOID:da0958ca0c019309d7380ec0c42e8d92]] It's often challenging to find a pretty case that offers sufficient protection for my large-screen phone. I've watched videos to see where the vulnerabilities are that cause so many large iPhone screens to crack. The center is the flex point, so it's essential to beef up the rigidity on the sides of the case. I am afraid this Kit Me out World sparkly gel case does not offer the level of protection I desire for my expensive XS max iPhone. This case is constructed with three layers that amount to nothing more than a sparkly piece of paper with a hard plastic backing and a flexible outer shell. None of the layers are aligned, and there are visible gaps, so it just looks cheap and poorly made. Perhaps I received a factory second because I have other cases by this manufacturer and the overall quality was much better. I thought I would love this case because it matches the color of my phone, but. I cannot recommend it based on the one I received.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FSddPZIDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FSddPZIDL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FSddPZIDL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81F3xrr6b8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81F3xrr6b8L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81F3xrr6b8L._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81acKwKwmNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81acKwKwmNL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81acKwKwmNL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hvmPOjeNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hvmPOjeNL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hvmPOjeNL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B07R7KSK2F,B07R7KSK2F,AGYRMITUSD6IEQMJDPHYMA7CJI2Q,2019-08-16 23:46:27.588,2,False,Loved reading about there adventures.

2.0,** UPDATE **Folding prongs bad design,"See update below review:<br /><br />Looks can be deceiving. The ANKER USB-C 25W PD Fast Wall Charger looks well designed and sturdy, but the smallest error in calculations or the manufacturing process going awry can destroy the best of intentions.<br /><br />It was about a month after receiving the charger that I started to have issues with it working. I started to send it back then (about 6 weeks ago) , however my past experience with Anker products being reliable, at a lower price point than top of the line of electrical/electronic products and not wanting to go through the return process had me hesitate. Now it is acting up again on a more regular basis.<br /><br />The problem is that the folding of the outlet prongs don't stay set internally and the prongs fold just enough to lose contact inside the unit and then it stops charging. I have jiggled and fiddled with putting up with it for too long now. I don't feel that sending back an electrical product after using it this long is proper.<br /><br />However, I did see that even though the return window had closed, there was product support for 90 days and it was within this parameter. So I chatted with an Amazon support bot and finally had to request a call back. The Amazon live agent did a good will return on this. Not sure I should have used a 'good will' credit for such a low priced item, but I did.<br /><br />All in all I would not recommend this charger. In the future I think I will try not to get a charger with folding prongs for travel. I have plenty of these that still work and the chance of them not being made correctly and thus not working is multipled over a simple normal stationary prong.<br />*** UPDATE JAN 13 2023 ***<br />Anker saw the review that I did on this charger and the problem with the folding prongs that were defective and not allowing electricity to flow through to the charger. They reached out to me and asked if I would like a refund or replacement. This was done quite a while past any normal return period.

5.0,So glad I picked this one.,"I've been looking for a Bluetooth headset for a while now to pair with my landline phone in my office. The phone is wired so getting up in the middle of a conversation is not possible. Holding the receiver between my ear and shoulder was becoming painful. I am at work 9 hours a day and on the phone, most days at least 1/2 that time. Needless to say, I'm on the phone a lot! I borrowed my boss' Parrott headset and while I loved the concept, I hated the feel and look of that clunky thing on my head. I started researching the best Bluetooth headsets and settled on this one. I figured I would try it and if it didn't work, I would send it back. I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />This one is comfortable enough to keep on my ear all day. It goes on easily. I hear great and others hear me perfectly without hearing a lot of background noise. The battery life is wonderful. I charge it on Friday afternoon before I leave work and it's good to go Monday morning. Using the C charger is even better because I already have one of those at my desk for my cell phone.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about which headset to get, you won't be disappointed if you choose this one.

Break out the Gorilla glue- don't use the screws, it won't work!","I love the MOBI HANDLE however the modifications one must go through if you have a silicon case isn't reasonable- especially if that silicon case is a military grade anti-impact case. The adhesive on the handle won't adhere to silicon cases so if you have one you are instructed to use the screws included in the kit to screw on the handle without using the adhesive pad. This not a good solution because the screws are very tiny, it is nearly impossible to create holes in a silicon case (especially if it is thick) and the included screwdriver is so small you cannot place enough torque on it to drive the screws through the case into the handle. Solution? I used Gorilla Glue to adhere the handle to the case (the case only cost me $12 so I am not overly worried about harming it). Gorilla Glue will stick to anything and it did- success!

What I do not like is that the touch screen protector that is part of it makes it difficult to touch the buttons.  For example: Passcode. You have to press down really hard and hold it down so the numbers will take. If you don’t hold it down, the number pressed will disappear.  It’s very annoying.<br /><br />Installation<br /><br />I followed the directions but it’s not that simple.  It states to insert crown side first and not to press down using the screen protector, to use the sides of it. That didn’t work for me. I continued to insert crown side first and slowly try to align the left side of the watch. It doesn’t go on easily.  I had to use the tip of my finger and carefully lift the left side of protector away from watch and use my other hand to press down. That popped on really fast.  It scared me with the actual screen. No damage, thank god.<br /><br />In summary, the protector is very strong and durable. I do not like the difficulty of trying to press buttons.  I gave it 4 stars for durability, but that screen protector needs some improvements.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61f1yP-qe7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61f1yP-qe7L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61f1yP-qe7L._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0BMF2TR27,B0C61MVDL3,AHDSEQNTSVKKO6RDLRWCNRDNCC5Q,2023-01-08 16:11:53.645,0,False,"Fun, educational, great images, and interesting"

If you are using any kind of camera that weighs more than 1 pound, I advise using only the lowest center post position.<br /><br />The ball head does have a nice metal ball that rotates smoothly, but the small screw lock doesn't lock very tightly.

4.0,"smaller than average for a 10000mAh battery pack, 18W charging speed, no UL safety certification","This battery pack is not as small as it appears in the product photos. Actual size is about 4.2 inches long. Still, it is noticeably smaller and lighter weight than other 10000mAh battery packs that I own.<br /><br />The battery pack has 3 different ports (USB-A, USB-C, and micro-USB). I am only using the USB-C port for both input and output. According to my power meter, the USB-C port handles about 18W of power for both input and output. That isn't as fast as some other battery packs that handle 30W or more, but it is much better than older battery packs that only handle 10W. 18W is probably fine for charging a smartphone, but maybe not for a tablet or laptop that supports USB-C charging and uses more electrical power.<br /><br />I am not able to accurately confirm that the capacity is really 10000mAh, but that number seems reasonable based on the battery capacity display during my real-world use.<br /><br />I do not like that this battery does not have any independent USA electrical safety certifications printed on the device, like the UL or ETL certifications that I see on many name-brand battery packs. I think independent certifications are important for devices like this that are known fire hazards. Many US companies will not buy any electrical devices unless they are UL-certified.

4.0,"Good Product, Just Falling Short of Greatness","First, vacillated between 4 and 5 stars.  4.5 might be about right, but I rounded up.<br /><br />Pros: quality is good, very, very close to full coverage on the phone.  Works with my Otterbox Commuter case - which &#34;just&#34; covers the top edge.  Cleaning materials were supplied along with dust spot remover/hinges.  I didn't really look closely at the glass, but it does appear to match the curve in the screen - so I shouldn't break it at the edge like my last one (installed by Verizon, don't know brand).  I did end up with one bit of dust - my fault, no reflection on the product.<br /><br />Cons: OK, why is it necessary to have the blacked out areas on the protector?  A skinny black border is OK, but WTF are you blacking out the non-screen areas?  Now, between my case and the screen protector, my 'platinum gold' S7 might as well be all black.  Additionally, the &#34;icons&#34; for the virtual buttons at the bottom of the screen are a total b*tch to align.  My are close, but not exact.  As far as I can tell, this is completely unnecessary, complicates needlessly the installation and makes my phone look dorky with a platinum gold physical button in a sea of black.<br /><br />When you come to your senses and just make this thing completely clear (which will reduce production expense - right?), please send me one.<br /><br />Now I've irritated myself.

I think if you have had successful experience doing a screen protector before, this wouldn't be a problem.

I cobbled together a connector where I could power it with a single input, but that takes some time putting together a wiring harness to do it.  It works as expected.

3.0,"A fairly good phone, just a few things to make it a leading phone in the mid-price class.","First the pros. It has a stylus and it cost 1/4 as much as the only others that do.  Long battery life. Lots of memory. Relatively clean software, free of excessive bloatware. Moto retained a mini headphone jack, helpful with plugging into my truck's stereo, via aux in. Lots of storage. Decent camera and photos.<br /><br />Now the cons. This phone is FRAGILE, don't even THINK about going caseless, and make it a good quality one at that with military drop specs. I dropped mine without a case 3 days into ownership. It literally shattered to pieces. 1st time ever I had a phone do that. So, case it up, and be careful with it. No Screencast, you don't realize how often you used and like that feature until you can't do it. No NFC... so you can't use google pay or other phone tap pay terminals. Not a big deal? Well, I forgot my wallet once, it sure was great to use my phone to get Gas, and lunch, 40 miles my home, and wallet left behind.  Only 2 software upgrades. (I learned post-sale about this, otherwise, I wouldn't be writing the review as a buyer)  That is unacceptable. Furthermore, let's see how long, or even if, Moto updates this phone which has the new Verizon UW and AT&T uber-fast 5G bands.

4.0,"Great Power Bank, But Solar Charging Not Great","I have been trying to get some power banks to help us in times of power outages which we get now and then.  This power bank has some good features and one that is not so great.<br /><br />SIZE<br />This is a substantial sized power bank.  It is not oversized, but it is not tiny either.<br /><br />PLUGS<br />I love the 3 different plug styles on this.  This will allow for recharging of Type c mini usb and lightning items.  The plugs tuck right into the unit which I LOVE<br /><br />CHARGING IN OUTLET<br />This charges pretty well in an outlet taking several hours at least to fully charge.  When charging with electrical outlet, there is no green light, just the blue ones flashing until it is full.<br /><br />CHARGING IN SUNLIGHT<br />Forget it.  This is ridiculously horrible when it comes to solar charging.  I have had this charging for DAYS in the light and it stays at the same level of stored power.  When the sunlight is charging it, there is a green light lit.<br /><br />CAN YOU CHARGE MORE THAN ONE ITEM AT THE SAME TIME?<br />I have charged both a bluetooth speaker and a Motorola Power phone at the same time.  One is mini USB and the other is Type C.  They charged up well, although they were slower than if one item at a time was charging.<br /><br />POWER DRAW<br />When using this bank full to charge up 2 cell phones and a large speaker, there was still half a power bank full of charge left.<br /><br />FLASHLIGHT<br />Although I usually don't use things like this for light, in an emergency it is handy to have.  This is a very bright light.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I love this power bank for the attached plugs, the nice amount of power it has, and the bright light.  The solar part is a fail for me.  I would hate to depend on this in an emergency.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  This is fabulous without the solar panel.  I have to take a star off for the solar panel being almost silly in my experience.  It really is not worth listing in features as it does very little.",[],B08L4DSWKY,B0C786DR9T,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,2020-12-28 22:37:33.571,4,False,Not as funny or natural as her older books
5.0,"Got This For My Fish Tanks, Works For What I Wanted","When I saw this, I was interested in it because it has two outlets for AC power.  It has all of the cool recharging options for phones, laptops, etc, but honestly, in a power outage, the last thing I am worried about is my devices.  We have survival things to attend to.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes with all of the cords and the battery.  I highly suggest you get a case for the cords and keep it tied to the handle of this battery so it does not get lost.<br /><br />HEAVY<br />This is not SUPER heavy, but it is not lightweight either.  That means if I am going hiking, this will be significant to carry with me.  I tend to want to keep this at home.<br /><br />HOW I USE THIS<br />I use this for the AC plug.  I put in the plug of my outlet strip that my fish tanks are hooked up to.  That powers the heaters and filters and lights.  If necessary, I unplug the lights and the heaters and just let the filters run most of the time.  I have 7 tanks, so I will alternate one side of the room for an hour then the other side of the room for an hour.  (By the way, you have to remember to press the AC button to activate the AC outlets).<br /><br />HOW LONG DOES THIS WORK?<br />In a power outage we had not long ago, the power was out for several hours.  I was able to run my pumps during that time when necessary and all was well.  I have not had to use it in an extended power failure, however.<br /><br />RECHARGING<br />I don't have a solar panel at the moment, but I do have a gas generator which is one reason I got this.  If we are in an extended situation, I can recharge this and use it for the tanks while other things are using the generator.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is perfect for taking some load off when we have power outages.  With 7 aquariums this helps me to keep the filters running for various tanks alternating to keep the tanks up and running while freeing up the generator for other things in the home.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This makes me really happy to have around.  It helps a lot when we have outages and that is really worth celebrating for me.  We tend to have seasons of outages and things like this are a must.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61swrCGTEZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61swrCGTEZL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61swrCGTEZL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0915HFDTC,B0915HFDTC,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,2021-09-15 16:39:34.069,2,False,Funny and non aggressive conversation starter

Now that she has her own place, she wants to have some extra camera equipment to do some photos from her location so she does not have to do it from home.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes in a box.  It has a cell phone holder and a screw on adapter for a camera.<br /><br />HOW I USED THIS<br />I got this for a regular G12 camera from Canon.  It is not overly big.  This was to be for my daughter who has a larger Fuji camera.  I screwed this onto the camera and pointed it at me while I was holding something to take a photo.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br />Honestly, this is not as nice as another one I have used in the past.  I found that it was not very stable just standing up, and that it was hard to get the legs to bend where I wanted them to and stay put.  It seemed like the camera was always shifting when I didn’t want it to.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />When using this for a regular small camera, this just was not as stable as I wanted it to be.  It works, but I have to fuss with it more than I should.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  This tripod is a good idea, but not nearly as strong or stable as others I have used in the past.

It is designed for contracting work so it is a bit thicker and larger than his other phone.  Since his pockets on some of his pants are a bit frustrating to fit a phone in, he wanted an alternative.<br /><br />HOW THIS WORKS<br />This slides onto the belt sideways or upright.  The flap shuts and opens easily when you pull on it.<br /><br />FIT<br />This fits his Zeeker phone very well which is about twice as thick as his Moto G Power phone he was using.  It does not slide out easily so it does not get loose when he is wearing it.<br /><br />ANY ISSUES?<br />So far my husband has been a bit frustrated in certain jobs when he wears this.  It can flip open or get in his way when he has to crawl into small spaces or maneuver into tiny spots in buildings.  He is trying to figure out a method to keep using this while not getting in his way.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This holds the new Zeeker phone for contractors.  It is a nice fit.  The only challenge is to keep it on his person while my husband tries to do sub contracting jobs.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.

It does not seem compatible with various proprietary fast charging standards, but it also doesn't charge things slowly, it puts out plenty of power to top off devices even during use.<br /><br />It feels very sold - it has some heft in the hand, the materials are dense and smooth, there is a pleasing matte finish to it. I'd like it to seat a bit better/more tightly in the cigarette lighter socket, but that may be the socket and not the charger.<br /><br />My major complaint is that the power on this unit is not isolated, which means it is capable of creating a ground loop with analog audio devices, thus putting out a hum. This is disappointed for a device of this kind, even if analog audio is considerably more rare these days than it used to be. I have a much less expensive USB DC-DC buck converter which I tied in elsewhere in the car, and that does not have any such issue. Indeed this is how I know the noise is from the Anker - the exact same setup on the buck converter, which is connected to the same socket, has no issue were as the Anker has noise where ever it is connected. This necessitates the use of an isolator somewhere else in my setup.<br /><br />If you don't care about the noise, then there's no problem, this is a good car charger.

Elastic bands allow for more flexibility in terms of how tight the band is worn, so this works well for me.<br /><br />I purchased this set of 2 bands (the multi-colored ""rainbow""-ish ones) mostly for the colors -- we're heading into spring here in the Pacific NW, which means our gray cloudy chilly days will soon be replaced by less-gray sunnier warmer days -- with the burst of spring color that follows.  It just seemed fitting to replace my gray stretchy band with a multi-colored stretchy band.<br /><br />In terms of quality, I have no complaints at all.  The band stays secure -- it doesn't loosen with wearing (I think another review mentioned that -- it hasn't happened in my case).  The ""clasp"" (more like a sliding size adjustor) stays put, and no metal touches my skin (I'm kind of allergic to some metals) -- no discomfort there at all.

They “register” as far as immediate recognition much faster and cleaner than the alternatives I've tried.  I do quite a lot of fine detail work.  With other brands, I would need to touch/drag multiple times before it actually selected or moved text or item.  Not so with the Friendlly Swede.  It works every time with no need to repeat the gestures.<br /><br />The multipacks are a good bargain as you get extra replacement tips (and instructions on how to swap out the bad tip for a new one).  I like to tuck an extra stylus in my travel bag just in case I misplace one (yes, it has happened before).<br /><br />This will be my “go-to” brand for styluses in the future -- no more succumbing to the temptation of a lower-price “bargain.”  You really do get what you pay for.",[],B07STJ6FK5,B07CMG8PB4,AHRGTIMQO47C2VLJILIDU53BQKSA,2022-05-09 07:09:05.447,0,True,Math for Fun

5.0,A valuable tool for professional video from your phone!,"[[VIDEOID:e1c57ba1dee06e198768d7b37b29c652]] I got this SMOOTH 5 gimbal from Zhiyun for some video that I will be shooting of our new patio construction. It's a big project and I wanted some good documentation of it for my Yelp review of the company that's doing the installation. It took me a while to make my selection. The SMOOTH 5 won, with it's features, benefits and a great low price for such a professional tool.<br /><br />This gimbal is like my drones, complex, but worth every minute you spend doing the set up and programming. First, you have to learn how to hold it. Any hand held gimbal needs to be held where the handle is as vertical as possible at all times. Once you figure out all of the controls and features, it becomes much simpler to operate. Being able to 'point and shoot', using the controls on the gimbal to operate the camera is freakin' awesome. I would write a book, trying to go into detail about all of the functions.<br /><br />I practiced a while, before I actually got a video that I felt I could share here. You can see that, despite my unsteady gate and movement, the gimbal kept the video smooth and steady at all times.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this gimbal and will be using it, A LOT!","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tG07-F+UL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tG07-F+UL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tG07-F+UL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LO+bdaQ4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LO+bdaQ4L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LO+bdaQ4L._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fmbcPfBCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fmbcPfBCL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fmbcPfBCL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xPcVKHMeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xPcVKHMeL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xPcVKHMeL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B09LV5XH2D,B09LV5XH2D,AHTDYGXHONM2BHENDRMKMC34ZZZA,2022-05-03 12:16:24.711,9,True,Georgie in Luck for Once (Or is She?)

BUT, it does have two minor drawbacks. 1) It does not come up around the face of the phone enough to overlap the screen protector. 2) The ring works as a stand, only in landscape mode. And, even then, isn't that stable. So, even though gave it 5 stars for all it's listed features, it still only gets three stars, overall.",[],B0B1HTSQSV,B0BJVJVKZL,AHTDYGXHONM2BHENDRMKMC34ZZZA,2022-10-30 18:58:28.453,2,True,Would have definitely liked a more likeable heroine! A bit lacking. 2.5-3
5.0,I can finally dump the land line!,"Okay, first I have to say that I am VERY happy with this purchase. It gets five stars from me.<br /><br />Now, I'll give you my story. When we first moved to this area, the cell phone signal was great. But, over the years, it's gotten worse and worse. The explanation I got from the carrier was that they couldn't keep up with the population growth and get enough bandwidth to provide decent service to all the customers.<br /><br />Central Texas has been booming. None of the infrastructure is growing fast enough to meet the needs. Our cell phone service provider is no exception. It got to the point where we couldn't rely on our cell service at all, in our own home. We had to carry our cordless land line phones with us all the time. It was very frustrating.<br /><br />Based on my brother-in-laws experience and recommendations, I decided to try a signal booster. After doing WEEKS of research, I decided on this one from HiBoost. It took me a while to decide. These things aren't cheap.<br /><br />The installation and setup of this system is complex and requires a good amount of work. If you're not technically inclined, a regular handyman and able to climb ladders, roofs and do a lot of physical work, I recommend you get someone to do this for you. I'm 68 years old. But, still very physically active and very handy with tools and technical projects. So, I was able to do it myself.<br /><br />The entire kit is very well engineered, designed and built with top quality materials and components.  The one thing that they don't include is a roof top antenna mast. There are several economical models available on Amazon. I was fortunate that my Dish antenna mast was close enough to an entry point that I could use it, instead of mounting another mast on the roof.  The installation was somewhat easy.<br /><br />You need to lay out all the cables and components first, figure out how long the runs are and where to mount what. They provide a small diameter 'window' cable, so you don't have to drill through a wall.<br /><br />The best way to program it requires two people, one reading the signal strength on the amplifier and another to adjust the receiver. They also have an app that allows one person to do it. But, the two person method is preferred.<br /><br />The results are awesome. I went from one bar of reception in the house, to FOUR bars. Outside, I had two bars. You need to understand that, if you don't have any signal where you are, this device won't help. But, if you have ANY signal at all, this will definitely increase that signal and provide greater coverage in your home.<br /><br />I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mn4kmRZWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mn4kmRZWL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mn4kmRZWL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711MwMKmGML._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711MwMKmGML._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711MwMKmGML._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nyt1K6+jL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nyt1K6+jL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nyt1K6+jL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81aDjuYeS1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81aDjuYeS1L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81aDjuYeS1L._SL256_.jpg'}]",B07GRBV1XZ,B0C3M446X8,AHTDYGXHONM2BHENDRMKMC34ZZZA,2022-11-08 20:55:42.982,12,True,"I should have loved it, but it was just so so..... 2/2.5"

4.0,Good Wireless Charger,"This is the perfect size and simple enough design.  It charges three QI devices and devices with QI adapters just fine.  When charging multiple devices you will notice the amount of time it takes is greater, but this is to be expected on most multi device chargers even the directly connected ones.  This is nice enough to set out on your desk while working.  The leather on it is a nice touch and doesn't seem to affect the output from the coils.  It doesn't get as hot as a lot of others tend to and my phone doesn't get nearly as hot either however,  I don't use fast charge on my devices.  I did turn it on just to see the difference and fast charge certainly is faster and only gets slightly hotter, but I am old school and believe that a slower more stable charge is better but this is configurable in your device settings.<br /><br />Great job with this one.  Thanks.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6112jDHrujL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6112jDHrujL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6112jDHrujL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-2l7s-33L.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-2l7s-33L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-2l7s-33L._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71d34XQVBCL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71d34XQVBCL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71d34XQVBCL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B078MKF7Y8,B09YNPBVK1,AHVVW7WV3NTVWZXX6ET7PUHUPXIQ,2020-01-17 17:50:06.731,0,True,Reads like a script for a movie

3.0,Not sturdy enough for rough handling,"There is no information in the product description as to where these cases are manufactured. I assume it is *not* the US, or the seller would have been strongly advertising that fact as a highly desirable feature in the US market.<br /><br />These small carrying cases are all the same black color, but four of them each has a different color for their edging: red, yellow, aqua and purple. There is also a matching carabiner of those same four colors, as well as a fifth one that is black to go with the plain black case.<br /><br />I have a lot of earbuds and an MP3 player lying around the house which did not come with their own carrying case. And though some of my Bluetooth headphones came with a case, their cases are not designed, as these are, to attach to a belt loop, a purse handle, or a key ring. This case works well for all of them, other than my Bluetooth sports headphones which have an ear loop. I can put them in one of these cases, but it is a very tight fit.<br /><br />My only real complaint about these cases is their zippers. I struggled with some of the zippers, though not all of them, while trying to get them to open and close. Due to the relatively cheap price of these cases, I did not expect fantastic quality, so I wasn’t entirely shocked. These cases are obviously inexpensively made, and it takes time, effort and careful attention to install zippers properly. Since so many manufacturers of cheap consumer goods keep their prices down by cutting corners on employee working conditions in factories, it is not surprising to me that zippers would become a source of product fail due to forcing those employees to rush through their work in order to meet employer quotas. In addition, the way these cases are packed for shipment—fully unzipped, laid out wide open, and stacked one inside the other—is very likely an additional factor contributing to zipper fail, because it puts strain on the zippers when held in that position for a long time.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91BZy+GG24L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91BZy+GG24L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91BZy+GG24L._SL256_.jpg'}]",B07QTX4XVX,B07QTX4XVX,AHW7ETGBKGX6DCG2LBAG5YAXU46A,2020-06-07 21:59:52.028,1,False,Man vs. Militia

4.0,Much better than most cases out there,"We are partial to Otterbox and iFace cases, but when I saw this one, I liked the perforated holes that allow for the phone to cool, so I thought I would give it a try. First, let me say that it is a solid case and I did feel it would protect my phone fairly well. Is it an Otterbox? NO. Is it an iFace with the rubber, shock-absorbing edges? NO. However, it's still a solid case an you can tell it is like the Kate Spade ones where they are for fashion with zero protection. I would say this one provides an average amount of protection. Since screens are so easy to crack, I usually like my cases to come a little bit higher than the screen so it gives it a bit more protection if it lands flat. If coupled with a glass screen cover, you can't get better protection and I have never had a broken phone between using the two. This case doesn't give too much of an additional lip beyond the glass screen, only a slight lift. But, it's still better than a lot of cases I have seen. I would recommend it for average protection on a phone, but would definitely make sure I also had a glass screen cover for a bit of extra protection around the edges.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614D4KqaW5L.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614D4KqaW5L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614D4KqaW5L._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MSlcc8iDL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MSlcc8iDL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MSlcc8iDL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wJ6zoC8RL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wJ6zoC8RL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wJ6zoC8RL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B07X1LY593,B07YQP2XG2,AE2BLXPEH643OUNYUROLEJOHCMWQ,2020-02-09 21:00:40.900,0,False,"Action, intelligent characters set in a new sort of dystopia in the Northwest of Canada"

You get used to the magnet being there pretty quickly. It does have great hold on the magnet for the stand. Matter of fact, the hold is so good that you have to put some Force into getting the phone off of it. I generally just slide my phone down from the holder, and that usually does the trick.<br />My only concern with that is if I am weakening the air vent that the holder is clipped to. Over time, I figured that the spot where the holder is is going to fracture and break. Especially due to the fact that I am in such an extreme climate, texas, and that it can get pretty hot in the car. I got this phone holder in the fall, so it has not had to suffer through a Texas heatwave. Only time will tell whether or not this magnetic holder can endure.<br />So far, so good though. I got this upgraded version of the v i c s e e d model after the previous nut and bolt attachment on the clip-in holder cracked. That one I was using during the spring and Summer here in texas. I believe that the joint part that screws in over the ball, cracked due to always being moved and having to hold up a phone , in combination with temperatures going up and down all the time. But, it was also a pretty thin piece of plastic. It was fairly lightweight and hollow. So, this in comparison to the older model, is much better. I do appreciate the opportunity to try this one out versus the older model. I saw this model in an email that I received from the company after I wrote them about the warranty on the older model. They did send me a replacement joint for the clip-in model, but it's more convenient to just have the magnet.<br />I also noticed that if you do not put the circle magnet on your phone almost all the way perfectly on the circle of the stationary magnet, it can slip off and fall. I did that once, and learn my lesson. I had to drive the whole way home with my phone on the floor of my car. If you don't get the phone at least 75% of the way on to the holder, it will not hold.<br /><br />Overall, I am impressed with this holder, alright I initially doubted whether I would like it. Took me about a week to actually decide to use it. Took me about 2 months too decide to use to the old one. But having a phone holder does make it more convenient when driving.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n-pDCWUlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n-pDCWUlL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n-pDCWUlL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0BF54FTNL,B0BVM4P8C7,AE2IXS44ZDWKYFI3RAH5S7OEQW6Q,2022-12-14 01:57:33.629,0,True,"excellent as part of a series, very good on its own"

5.0,Excellent protection for your Pixel phone!,"I had an Otterbox for my first iPhone, an iPhone 4, and I was really impressed by it. My son, who received an identical iPhone and Otterbox, informed me that Otterboxes were for... old people. Slings and arrows! Anyway, my iPhone 4 is still alive and ticking, while his suffered injury after injury until it had to be replaced. My point being that when I recently switched from Apple to Google's Pixel phone, I was very interested in the Otterbox for it.<br /><br />(Please see photo) The Otterbox looks great and does an excellent job of protecting the phone, which is kind of slippery IMHO. It does not come with a screen protector that I could locate. I did manage to make things difficult for myself during installation when I neglected to remove the thin silicon case I had installed on the Pixel. Seriously. I couldn't figure out how to install the Otterbox. Eventually I realized that I had neglected to remove the silicon case I had purchased. Once that was removed, installation was a breeze, fits great, looks great, has &#34;grippy&#34;-type of rubber pads where you want them, the buttons are easily accessible -- totally great. Love this product. I don't want to drop my new phone, which wasn't cheap.<br /><br />So if you can get past having a teenager tell you that Otterboxes are for old people, BUY THIS PRODUCT! I'm more interested in preserving my new phone than I am in looking cool to teenagers anyway!","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619CkOEJZuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619CkOEJZuL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619CkOEJZuL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KpV5lbR3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KpV5lbR3L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KpV5lbR3L._SL256_.jpg'}]",B01MCSSIG4,B01N3QT77I,AE2ODZ4VYQ5FNNCONSHSNZM7PHSQ,2016-11-22 21:58:46.000,8,False,"Money for nothing, Buying for free"

5.0,Great protector Great Service & Support!,"I've long trusted the accessories I receive from Anker. I've had cables, chargers and many other products over the years of having smart phones and their screen protectors really do a great job as well. I recently had purchased this 2pk of the 'Anker GlassGuard Screen Protector for iPhone XR 2018' for both mine and my wife's phones. For just over a year the protectors worked very well and were met with an unfortunate slight crack/failure over the course of the next few months.  I was quite happy that the protector did NOT allow damage to either phone's actual screen which is the purpose, but I was hoping they'd last a little longer.  One of the best parts of the Anker brand is they stand behind their products even for these screen protectors that  generally see a lot of usage with how much we all use our phones and so many chances to bump, drop or scratch no matter how careful we are.  The support team (notably Yvonne) was able to provide a full replacement through their site and quickly communicated and shipped things with simply having to verify the purchase and show the picture of the cracked screen protectors.  I really appreciate the ease of support and the completely reasonable and expected process to provide a new set which we are very happy with. Thanks Anker for having taken great care of this lifelong customer!",[],B07GXDW6LJ,B07GXDW6LJ,AE6FJWLHTPXIMSLMUTF5YXODCRQA,2019-08-05 13:02:23.477,1,True,A great read
2.0,Not really sure yet,I attempted to install the screen cover and I have to say it barely feels like more than those semi rubbery covers you get to take off electronics when you first buy them.  I wouldn't exactly consider them protection other than basic smudge level covers that amount to preventing finger prints.  As I almost got the first one on it was so flimsy it started to fold up like how duct tape does if you let it fold onto itself and then as with the tape it's about ruined and by that point I just threw it away.  I'm not impressed but I will still give them 2 stars for what I'm sure is an ok cover but I guess maybe having 6 to a pkg makes up a little for trial and error getting ONE of them to work right.,[],B07G8VMKQ7,B07G8VMKQ7,AE6FJWLHTPXIMSLMUTF5YXODCRQA,2019-08-19 19:42:02.007,0,True,"Other books are complicated , but not this one for making different types of Sourdough breads."
4.0,Great sturdy stand,"I really like this stand for a number of reasons with one catch. I'm very impressed with its sturdiness and solid frame as well as the angle it holds the device. I like that the cushions are not too sticky and not all over to take away from the look and ability to move it around as needed, but also keep it in place without worrying it might slip. However, the one knock I have is that if you don't have a case on the device, the front part of the holding arms do not appear to have any cushion on them. I think if I didn't have a case and I would be removing the device with any quickness that the screen or whatever side was out at the time would scratch easily. I haven't tried it specifically for good reason, but I have noticed that about every time I remove the device it seems that I'm rubbing/scratching against my case edge and I'd hate for that to be my screen even with a screen cover on it and no edge protection.  Overall I really like it and like any piece of metal in general with a rough surface there's a chance of scratching something else much like how 3000 MacPro's or any Mac/iPad...  aluminum ASUS and so on can scratch in an instance from just about anything else that's slightly rough metal or whatever.

But at 1 a month, they are gonna get pricy. I'll be trying a few other brands and see if it's just glass or this brand in specific that seems really shatter-prone.

5.0,Not exactly as advertised - durable yes but not completely confident in protection,"The Caseology Legion Violet Case for Galaxy S9 (2018) is a good product but not great.  After having it for about a year, there are a few things I like about it and others not so much.<br /><br />While the case is durable, easy to hold, and enables me to use all the ports, power button, and volume rocker easily, and it also works well with wireless charging, the case does not confidently protect a Galaxy S9.  The photos will show that the screen of the Galaxy S9 phone curves out further than the case can protect, if dropped.<br /><br />The photos also show a Zapp screen protector from before it cracked when the phone was knocked off a shelf approximately 3 feet onto vinyl flooring.  Both the case and the screen protector combined saved the phone and technically did their job.<br /><br />Notice the gap between the display and the screen protector and the case – it is not adequately protected.  That gap is sharp and a dust magnet.  Without the screen protector the case is fair, although it doesn’t account for the few millimeters of the phone screen rising above the edges of the case itself.  If dropped face down, the case will not protect the phone.<br /><br />You can also see in the photos; fingerprints are very easily seen on the color portion of the case that is also not textured enough for confidence with grip while holding the phone.  The SIDES of the case have an adequate grip, however even a light texture added to the back of the case would have been an appropriate addition.<br /><br />My personal experience with this case is that while it is a good product, it is not designed to protect an S9 with the curved screen bulging past the case.  This small discrepancy leaves S9 phones with little to no protection especially if dropped on a hard surface.<br /><br />I have not been able to find an decent screen protector to work with this case.  This could be a design flaw of the phone because when researching cases and screensavers for the Galaxy S9 most everyone has the same complaint about the display of the phone curving toward the edge.<br /><br />My main concern is that this case advertises protection and after having it for nearly a year, I cannot say with 100% certainty this case would be a product I would purchase FOR protection.<br /><br />There will more than likely be a few of you out there who will point out that my phone was protected from the fall and you would be correct as I stated above.  However, a 3 foot drop onto a vinyl floor should not have caused ANY damage to any part of the device or screen protector.  That curved screen is not amply covered to be protected.<br /><br />Caseology is a good product, I have had a few cases prior that have all done the job described, however this is the only model I am not 100% confident to protect my device especially considering it states ""Reinforced Protection"".","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7uiKw5iL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7uiKw5iL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7uiKw5iL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7uiKw5iL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7uiKw5iL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7uiKw5iL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NCtp1MMcL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NCtp1MMcL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NCtp1MMcL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B079K5ZSCF,B079K5ZSCF,AEF52WSZ6A2VTLEHNS44GKIYPOEA,2019-06-07 22:39:45.389,3,True,"Couldn't decide what story it wanted to be - mystery, romance, mid-life angst....not great"

3.0,Nice light easy to use band but shorter than listed.,"Disappointed. This is a single strap. While it is long, about 2 1/2-3"" is a hook material which folds over onto a soft velcro like material. And that feels very secure, if you have small to medium wrist, not a big wrist. It will not  latch, it just pops loose.<br />Which is a shame, they feel nice, lightweight, the band has a little give,  but not bungie cord stretch. Also of note, while the velcro closure is pretty secure and omn its own I don't see it coming lose, the flap could catch on something and come lose. BUT because of the way it is atta he'd chances of the watch coming off your wrist are slim. Just an FYI for active folks, or folks like me who bump their watch while working.<br />I love the newer style pins, so much easier to install. Sadly they are getting returned.<br /><br />So to sum up:<br />Comfy fabric like band w/a little stretch<br />Easy open/close Velcro like design closure<br />Remains pretty secure when closed<br />Lightweight<br />Looks good<br />Easy to install<br /><br />Lose almost 3"" length so not a good option for big wrists",[],B089NQXZT5,B089NQXZT5,AEFRGGNPKEWQDLKBTYQSF72WPHSA,2021-05-04 11:28:29.112,0,True,Good Summer Read

But to take it off, flip up the magnetic clasp slide it through the ""rectangular ring, easy plastic. Putting it back on, one handed, that takes some work. That being said, I have reduced feeling in my hands, again while doable, I look like I am having a moment.<br />This band is not light, but not as heavy say a metal link band.<br />It is a metal mesh, a rather fine chainmail. So it is flexible, not stiff.<br />Overall I really like this band.<br />Pros:<br />Looks good<br />Easy off<br />Easy to install<br />Feels substantial<br /><br />Cons:<br />Hard to get back on (For me, but I am going to reverse the band, see if that helps)<br />Closure slips a little throughout the day<br /><br />So one star off for the putting on issue, slippage and the coating being slowly removed by the magnetic clasps as ot slides.

4.0,Works with my phone in its case...almost,"So many of the phone holders out there are either klunky grabbing things or just aren't designed to be used with phones that are in their cases. I have a credit card case on my Samsung S8, which makes it too thick to be held by most holders, but it fits in this cup holder almost just right. I say that, because the edge of my phone case sits right at the edge of this holder's opening. I can push it down hard into the opening, which will push out the flexible front lips a little, and the phone will sit just fine until I slam on the breaks. It is angled well, but I think if it were angled back a little bit more, the phone would be less likely to tip out (again, in its case) in fast-breaking scenarios. The lip is not adjustable; I'm not sure if the leading brand-name cup holder is either. I am going to use a bit of black Suguru that I have on hand to edge the lip so there will be no danger of this happening; that, or I'll just slip a rubber band around the bottom.

5.0,"It's not you, it's me...","Update 07.11.22: Due to the ""snap on"" outer case, even the corners of this type of protector lift up every time I change my case (which is daily), therefore, the bubbles never disappear and are very unsightly. These are of excellent quality, very strong and solidly secures to the device, it's just the way the outer case snaps on that causes the problem...my search continues.<br /><br />Original review...<br />Because of the way the outer cases snap on, it peels back the pre-installed film screen protector which ruins the edges. I applied this glass protector easily but it's also easy to catch a few pieces of lint underneath (drives me crazy lol) so I had to use the 2nd protector and applied it flawlessly. There were air bubbles on all 4 corners but they are dissipating one at a time. So far, no issues with the corners lifting up when snapping on the front case.

4.0,Needs modifications...,"I  will say these are very similar to the mfg installed front protector which I happened to like. I thought the application process was strange, actually backwards. I do a pretty good job aligning and applying screen protectors in one try w/o lint getting trapped underneath, however, the backside ratio is divided from top to bottom like 60/40 vs the usual 50/50. This forces the application to begin at the bottom then working upwards which I find odd. Also, the bare bones instructions provided are written in poor, broken English which made them difficult to follow resulting in me using two of the three protectors.<br /><br />Once on, the adhesive is great, doesn't interfere with screen sensitivity and it's smooth (all bubbles disappeared within 2 days) but....I'm finding the Z Fold 3 snap on cases aren't made to fit properly with any front protector. I've tried 3-4 different types/brands and this is always the constant issue. So to prevent the corners from being pushed up by the case, I had to trim each of the outer corners with scissors to make room for the case to snap on securely w/o disturbing the protector. It doesn't look bad since it's covered by the case and it did solve the problem but the ideal solution is to make snap on cases to accommodate the protectors. Bottom line, these worked best of the few I've tried, 3 for the price is a good deal and I would repurchase if in need (at this price).",[],B09NCW3Y54,B09NCW3Y54,AEO77PF7QZ6WQOZVVUZMLVGVIW6Q,2022-08-07 07:01:43.438,0,True,"When hungry, we'll eat anything, so why not try a tasty little morsel"

My husband got it first, he is using his phone daily, but really is more of an occasional user outside of home and work wifi. He loves it, the price is great, he gets unlimited calls and texts and since he rarely uses data, he is happy as a clam. Me on the other hand, I'm using all, especially data a lot... mint sucks! I've got 5 bars 5G and still, it takes apps and searches to load multiple minutes. 50% of searches time out, while in the middle of a suburban area with excellent coverage. Customers service claims my phone might be the issue, it's not, worked great on t-mobile itself?!? They admitted that they are second class on the t-mobile network and get slowed down if there is a lot of use on the network. OK with that price, maybe I have to live with slower speeds, but not with constant timed out searches and loading speeds of multiple minutes. It's ridiculous and I'm very angry that I switched and left my cheap grandfathered in T-mobile plan to save $10 more per month.<br /><br />Soooo if you are a light user with patience and a smaller budget this works... if you are the main person in the household that needs data...

I would have been happy getting 4 charges out of it and I might have kept it, but with the poor performance, I did not want to keep it and waste money.

5.0,Fast Wireless Charger Performs Better Than Samsung Wireless Charger,"This ANKER WIRELESS CHARGER WITH POWER ADAPTER (PowerWave II Pad, Qi-Certified 15W Max Fast Wireless Charging Pad) definitely charges my Galaxy S10 cell phone faster than my original, official, Samsung Qi-charging pad.  All I have to do is center my Qi-enabled phone atop the Anker pad, and the charging begins.<br /><br />The Anker charging pad has a small blue light on the front that lights up when the pad is actively charging.  As long as you center your phone sideways on the Anker pad, you can easily see the light.  The charger is noiseless.  (Like all wireless chargers, this one charges more slowly than a phone cable connected directly to an AC outlet.)<br /><br />If you have a Galaxy S10 phone, you don’t even need a light on your wireless charging pad.  The phone’s display tells you everything you need to know about the charging status--whether the phone is charging, how much charge is currently in your phone, and how much time remains before the phone is fully charged.  When the phone is 100% charged, the display tells you that as well.<br /><br />Anker products have a good reputation for quality and reliability.  All of the Anker products that I’ve actually tried (mostly power banks and backup batteries) have lived up to that reputation.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711RrWNcjdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711RrWNcjdL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711RrWNcjdL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B083B9HB6Q,B083B9HB6Q,AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q,2020-03-08 21:30:04.841,1,False,"great writer, grreat book"

My Samsung Galaxy S10 phone recognizes it as a “fast charger” when it is plugged into my Honda Accord’s accessory power socket, and it seems to charge the phone quite fast.<br /><br />Both cables work.  Both cables have USB Type C plugs--the reversible oval kind that are used by newer Galaxy phones.  The blue light around the rim of the charger tells you it is connected.  The light also makes it easier to see the ports on the plugged-in charger, if your car’s accessory power socket is in a dark space like the Accord’s pocket or console.<br /><br />Note that this is a “Cluvox” car charger, not a “name brand” car charger, so the quality may not be as good as you might get from a more expensive charger purchased from a cell phone manufacturer or seller (e.g., Samsung, Verizon).

I’m unwilling to plug in a device that has a voltmeter, when the function of the voltmeter is NOT explained in the accompanying literature.<br /><br />I’m also turned off by the array of power on/off switches for the adapter and the individual sockets.  Presumably the device won’t drain my car battery if they’re all turned off, but who knows?  (Again, there’s nothing about car battery drainage in the instructions.)<br /><br />Even if the switches turn everything off that’s able to drain the battery, there’s no way that I won’t forget and leave one or more turned on some time when I turn off the car’s ignition.  For me to use a device like this, I need for the device to turn off automatically with the ignition.<br /><br />In the end, I don’t really need a bunch of extra accessory power sockets in my car.

I had hoped I only misplaced it and would show up again, but I think it fell out of my bag in a rental car. So here I am. I like Amazon products, so I figured I would go with this 20W. I find that a direct USB-C to USB-C combined with a 20W adapter makes for a very good charge. The same or better as a direct USB to USB-C into a wall receptacle. I use this primarily for charging my GooglePixel6pro. These are the cords I use [[ASIN:B07VJMBRVQ]].

I dont often need to be on the phone, and I dont typically want anything IN my ear, but there are some circumstances that I want a hands free, one ear free device to allow me to make and take calls, and to listen to other stuff. I didnt want to spend much (or wouldnt want to), so looking at the sub $35 price range was important. This is currently $30, so it fits what I am looking for.<br /><br />This has no noticeable interference or excess noise. I can hear well, and person on other end could hear me. Was nice using it while out for a walk as I didnt have to hold my phone, and wind and such didnt impede hearing.<br /><br />I love that the storage case is the charging case too.

I’m kind of “figure it out on my own” type. It took less than three (3) minutes to get the mount and ball/socket joint attached, and less than three (3) minutes to mount it to the vent on my car. Easy to put the phone in and secure as well as remove. Also, the design allows for a car charger as well. I am using a simple (but sturdy) case for my phone.

4.0,I really like this phone,"I really like this phone. I was a long time Motorola user, but didn't like that on their lower priced phones they stopped using Gorilla glass, so that caused me to look elsewhere. Enter in Nokia!  I bought the Nokia G50 and was pretty happy with the phone. The feel of it is great, it looks nice, has gorilla glass, does what I need it to and I was a pretty happy customer. The volume on the phone though isn't great and that was my only negative. I like to play music at work off my phone and it wasn't very loud, so that was disappointing. If you've got headphones in then it's fine, but I can't always use headphones.<br /><br />The other day my phone slipped out of my hand and dropped on the sidewalk. My screen shattered and I have had this phone for almost three months. I can't believe the glass shattered like that with the screen protector on. I'm heart broken 💔. However, I got the Nokia XR20 which is supposed to be heavy duty. I'm trying to find a repair shop to fix my screen on my G50. Two places already said they can't get the screen for the phone. If I can't find anyone, then I'll ship it to a Nokia care center and get it fixed. I guess I should have bought the added protection plan from Amazon.<br /><br />Update: I sent my phone to the Nokia care center and they fixed my shattered screen and sent my phone back in no time! They didn't even charge me for the repair. Gotta love them; they're wonderful! :)","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613ukczG1CL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613ukczG1CL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613ukczG1CL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qSIHrJDeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qSIHrJDeL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qSIHrJDeL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZLFKP6PnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZLFKP6PnL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZLFKP6PnL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B09GW969LH,B09HLWX1JW,AF7Z3245RF3NJKICNI4W4M3SJKEQ,2022-07-21 00:33:18.718,16,True,"Let's Do Something Special for Papa's 40th Birthday, They Thought..."

I figured this phone holder would be the solution since it's attached to the rearview mirror.<br />The piece itself seems pretty sturdy, I didn't feel like I needed to be very careful with it when I went to clip it onto the back of my rearview mirror.  Set up is very easy, after adjusting the width to fit the mirror, just squeeze the back tabs on each side together, and clip it on. After that, I shorted the front latches so that the holder was secured tightly to my mirror.<br />My phone clips on easily, and I like that I can pull it down or up and rotate it. What I don't like is that the extension that holds my phone shakes when I'm driving.  If my car didn't have bluetooth hookup and I couldn't use my gps on there, I would probably return this because there is no way I would be able to follow my gps on my phone if it was attached to this phone holder, because the screen gets waaay too shaky and unreadable when I'm driving on the highway.<br />Verdict: For the price, it's alright.  Would I go out of my way to purchase this again if this one ever needs to be replaced?  No.  I only plan to use this holder until the end of the winter, and then I'll be going back to my tried and true ac vent clip magnetic phone holder.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KTvhO4HlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KTvhO4HlL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KTvhO4HlL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0B58ZVBDB,B0B58ZVBDB,AFAQZ732NOPHGMU3OMFA2VXILXQA,2023-01-17 06:29:02.656,0,False,This book was a hit!
5.0,First Stress-Free Installation- EVER!,"I cannot tell you how happy I am with this screen protector.  I always dreaded putting screen protectors on, because of dust getting under, or not being able to line it up correctly, etc.  But this otter box screen protector took care of everything.  It comes with a microfiber clot and screen wipes- just like any other good screen protector, but the difference with this one is the installation box that it's in.  Whoever designed this needs a raise, because this made the installation SO easy!  The box adjusts to the size of your phone, and you just drop it in.  I cleaned the screen with the wipes and the cloth, removed the protector on the screen protector that is attached to the box, and just lowered it down over the phone, and it snapped into place!<br />Never have I ever installed a screen protector in one go.  I've always had to lift it up once or twice (or even three times more- which at that point I've given up and have decided to live with the dust under the protector), because of dust or because I didn't position it correctly.<br />The screen is clear, and there are no issues at all with the touch screen with this protector. I love that it blocks blue light.<br /><br />This protector is absolutely worth its higher price in my opinion. The fact alone that it rids you of the stress of installing is worth it to me.  Time will tell how durable the protector is.  I tend to have to repurchase screen protectors every 2-3 months from me cracking them because I always drop my phone.

The S10 case had a more rounded feeling, hence felt better in my small hand. I also noticed that the purple color of the edges look more ""purplish"" than the previous dusty purple one.<br /><br />Overall it is still a great case, but I prefer the previous design.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BxsfyNIgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BxsfyNIgL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BxsfyNIgL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sWDvtKlXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sWDvtKlXL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sWDvtKlXL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B08QQL2T28,B08QR1QZNC,AFCQQHOONBDK4QLNEFHM4VD5BELA,2021-02-19 17:13:43.705,0,False,A snap shot of colonial india and discovery of the camera

5.0,Even better than I had expected.,"I am so impressed with this pen. I bought a different pen before this one that claimed it worked with the 6th Gen IPad, but that was a joke. I found this one in a news story from Tech Watch and thought if it was good enough for Apple to use with their display models, that had to be positive. I am so happy that I bought this.<br /><br />The pen really does work with this model of IPad. The device even recognizes it as an Apple Pencil. The touch screen sensitivity is amazing and the palm rejection feature works beautifully, allowing you to rest your hand naturally on the screen to write and draw as you normally would on paper.<br /><br />The pen is very easy to set up, light and portable and not all that uncomfortable to use. I like the shape, as it ensures that it doesn’t roll off the desk or other surface when you set it down. The tip is durable and yet doesn’t scratch the front screen of the device, which, I must admit I was worried about with the previous pen I bought.<br /><br />The battery life is pretty good and will let you write or draw for a good number of hours before it needs recharging, which you can do with the lightning cable that comes with the IPad. The top of the pen is connected so you don’t lose it and it doesn’t require you to do anything special to begin using the pen right away. The writing is smooth and you can read your handwriting when you are done writing, a vast improvement over the last pen I tried. There is very little screen lag time and so it feels really natural to use this pen.<br /><br />Overall, for the price, I think this was a great investment. You can also get replacement tips directly from Logitech, 3 in a pack for a reasonable price for when the tip begins to wear down. I am super impressed with this pen. I’d definitely recommend it to other shoppers looking for something that is just as functional as the Apple Pencil, with half the price tag.",[],B07JFP5G4L,B0C54JDKFG,AFDNLNTANUGENK62RSTAQALJOWPQ,2019-07-07 15:13:42.521,6,True,"Geared toward readers familiar with sailing, interesting learning curve experience"

The writing is terribly inaccurate with awful skips and hit and miss jotting the rest of the time. I could actually write better with a 25 cent stylus than this thing, which, for the price, did not impress me at all.

Only morons are stupid enough to do that.<br />The TCL was less than half the cost of my Huawei. I'm glad I took a chance on it. I couldn't believe the enhancements that had occurred over 2 years.

5.0,Holds Your Phone Firmly in Place,"Cell phones are great for many reasons and while we know we shouldn’t use them while we drive, sometimes, we must do this, like when opening up a map and trying to follow it. To be safe, a phone mount is essential, and a good choice is this cell phone mount, made by Tronwin.<br /><br />My greatest problem with cell phone mounts is that they tend to not hold themselves in place. This is my number one demand when I purchase a cell phone mount for a car: It must be the type that clips on or otherwise grips in a way that it won’t fall off. Mounts that use suction cups are the worst. Clip on are best and this mount scores highly in this area. It clips to the air vent, and it holds firmly in place.<br /><br />This cell phone mount can hold just about any cell phone, regardless of its size. You just push the button to move the sides out, place your phone between, and the squeeze together. To release your phone, just push the button in the back once again. You can pull the base down, too, if necessary to make your phone fit.<br /><br />Another cool thing about this cell phone mount is that it can be moved around most any way you like. Other mounts will come loose if you try to move them too much. But with this mount, it can be moved to just the right angle. You can even turn it sideways, if you prefer to view your cell phone that way.<br /><br />Cell phones are a regular part of life. This cell phone mount from Tronwin is an excellent choice for all the reasons stated above. It stays secure and offers extra movement not possible with other mounts.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mfwPwHQzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mfwPwHQzL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mfwPwHQzL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WmF3IwPTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WmF3IwPTL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WmF3IwPTL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B09H64HDCR,B0B1ZBDRR3,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2022-01-02 16:39:24.694,1,False,Left me feeling like I was witnessing ugly gossip mongering.
5.0,Fast Charging Ability,"It can never hurt to have more charging cords available. With so many electronics in my home, we are always looking for charging cords and we often misplace them. To keep the iPad going strong, I decided to get this Galvanox PPS GaN Charger.<br /><br />This charge is like most others. The cord itself is detachable from the head of the plug, which means you can leave the head inserted into a socket, unplug the cord itself, and use it elsewhere. We often do this when we charge electronics in the car.<br /><br />You do get reasonably fast charging with this cord. With our ipad, it charges it at the rate of about 2 to 3 percent per minute, which is more than fast enough to meet our charging needs. I tend to leave charging cords plugged in, but if you need to unplug and store, just roll it up and place it in a drawer until your next use.<br /><br />With the proliferation of electronics, it is important to have the means to change readily available. This Galvanox Charger is quite good at its intended task and it earns an easy recommendation from me.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51l6cuLSD2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51l6cuLSD2L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51l6cuLSD2L._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0BS56TG2V,B0BS56TG2V,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2023-01-29 15:52:09.574,0,False,"Colorful, fun word and sentence builder"
4.0,Keeps Electronics Organized,"There never seems to be enough charging cords in my house. They get moved, placed in drawers, and otherwise misplaced right when we need them. It’s good to have the right cord for the specific electronic and a cord that cannot get lost, while also keeping things organized when you have a large number of devices to charge and this is where a charging station like this one can help.<br /><br />The best feature of this charging station is that it includes cords to accommodate different electronics, and that includes apple and Samsung. It takes a little assembly effort to get it ready, but once you’re finished, the slots are ready to handle your different electronics. The apple and usb cords make it efficient in this manner.<br /><br />This charging station does seem to charge a little faster than using our usual cords, so that is a plus. If you happen to live where power surges are commonplace, I recommend plugging it into a surge strip. It’s best not to take chances, especially if you have a large number of items plugged in.<br /><br />I like what I have experienced with this charging station. The only issue I have with the slots is that some electronics are too tall to fit. My ipad is one such item. Other than this annoyance, this charging station from Catlyn is good for households with varied electronics, since it helps charge many different devices at once and keeps things organized.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fqzioGKeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fqzioGKeL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fqzioGKeL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0BPXZWCBG,B0BPY47SY6,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2023-02-10 19:34:35.202,0,False,Great Book

4.0,Mostly good,"As of this writing, only the black case was available on Amazon so I purchased the red one direct through Supcase.  I've been loyal to this brand for years and they've protected my devices from what I thought was sure destruction more times than I can remember.<br /><br />This is my first edge case, however, and my first impressions are good, but not great.  The clear back looks sharp but I question its durability.  I also have camera protectors put on and while they fit through the opening, my phone no longer lays flat as it did with the case I had on while waiting for this one to arrive.  Not a deal breaker but I wish the camera protectors, which do not add bulk, were flush to this case's backing.<br /><br />Finally, I had to remove the fingerprint ""dot"" on the inside of the screen protector for two reasons: the first being that it was touch and go with whether or not it worked; secondly (and the ultimate reason I peeled it off) the dot was too visible, impeding my viewing experience.  The dot was completely transparent but its edges let me know it was there at all times, which was very distracting.<br /><br />All in all, I love the frame of the supcases as well as its screen protectors compared to the peel-n-stick ones that come with competitor brands.  I'm going to give this one a try but I may go back to the original style that has nontranspant back plate if I feel this one's durability isn't up to the task.  It is sharp looking for sure, but at the end of the day, protecting my device is priority.

It came with a screen cover but for now I’m using it without it.<br /><br />It has a slightly “gritty-hard rubber” feel to the case.

5.0,"Strong Suction Cup, Easy to Adjust","I selected this windshield mount to hold a GPS navigator as the suction cup that came with the navigator is weak and has a bad tendency to let go unexpectedly. So far it is working well for me, though admittedly I have not had it very long so there hasn’t been a lot of wear and tear on it yet.<br /><br />The main feature of this mount is definitely the suction cup. It’s super-sticky and it holds even when the temperature outside drops below freezing. Most regular suction cups have a bad tendency to lose suction and release when it gets cold, usually at the most inconvenient of times. I don’t know how cold it has to get before this one will let go, but it’s definitely a lower temperature than a typical dry suction cup.<br /><br />The bracket that holds the phone (or in my case the GPS) is designed to be worked with one hand and it works well. It opens easily and snaps closed when a phone is pressed into the bracket. The problem I have had with other brackets like this one is that the foam grips on the brackets have come out and get lost; hopefully this one will not have the same issue, and so far it hasn’t been a problem.<br /><br />I like the versatility in adjustments that can be made to get the position right. The arm telescopes out and the height can be positioned just right to either get it out of the way or to put it precisely where it needs to be so it’s easily accessible. A word of caution, though – when mounting to the windshield, take care to put the suction cup exactly where you want it, because once it’s placed it takes some deliberate effort to move it again. Typical suction cups are much easier to move and often can be shifted with one hand; don’t try that with this mount. The only additional adjustment that would make this mount even better would be to have the base on a swivel so the mount can be easily turned. I haven’t seen any mounts like that so far.<br /><br />So far I’m happy with this mount. It seems to be holding up well and the suction cup is nice and strong. It’s a bit difficult to move once it is mounted though this is one of its strengths. It has other adjustments that make is versatile enough to have limited movement once attached, and getting your device in and out of it is easy. This is easy to recommend based on my experience with it so far.",[],B07HD4HWNT,B07HD4HWNT,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2019-01-01 10:31:02.397,6,False,An Urgent Call for a Deeper Commitment to Christ
4.0,"Good Lens, Clip is Passable","I have worked with a number of lenses for phones and I have seen some interesting variations. Some require a special case to work with a phone (and therefore are model-specific) while others use a special clip that clamps over the phone’s lens. This one falls into the latter design type and for what it is it’s very good, though there is room for a little improvement.<br /><br />There are two main components to this lens. There is the clip to which the lens attaches, and there is the lens itself which is actually a pair of lenses. The clip is a solid and sturdy thing with a strong grip so I will not slip off the phone when in use, a problem I have seen with lenses of this type on occasion. The part that touches the back of the phone has a thin foam pad that provides grip, and the pad has a slight swivel action to it so in theory it will lay flat regardless of the phone’s shape. It works in that regard, even with the phone case on.<br /><br />Now, that said, to get this lens to really work I have to take my phone out of its case. That’s inconvenient but not a deal breaker for me because my phone case is a simple slip-on case. For those using a more complex case it may prove to be more tedious. There are things that could have been done to make it fit regardless of the case.<br /><br />The lens itself is a two-piece assembly, as many are. When assembled it is a wide-angle lens that enhances the field of view in the shot, especially when zoomed out. When only the base is used, it is a high-magnification macro lens that is great for taking clear pics of things that are very close. In both cases, I have found the images to come out with very little distortion and the images are clear and sharp. For the macro lens test I used my thumb as a test subject and I was able to get good ridge detail on my thumb print.<br /><br />The lens includes a nice cloth bag that keeps it clean and protects it from scratches. It’s not much protection against crush damage when the lens is stored in a book bag but it’s certainly better than nothing and will keep the lens mostly pristine when on the go.<br /><br />This is a good lens, let down by a basic clamp that could have been better. If you don’t mind taking your phone out of the case to use this lens, the lens will serve you well and you’ll be rewarded with solid, clear pics.",[],B07L3PKGCS,B07L3PKGCS,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2019-02-02 12:41:01.058,0,False,Life Is Filled With Possibilities - How To Embrace Uncertainty
5.0,Work as Expected,"With a couple of iPhones in the house I am always trying to track down lightning cables. I selected these in the hopes that they would be a viable alternative to buying Apple-branded cables. My concern with these cables is that the listing says nothing about MFi certification, so there is no guarantee that the cables will work properly. As it turns out, they work just fine, and the colors make the different cables easy to tell apart (for those of us that have color preferences).<br /><br />Without any indication of certification, I wasn’t sure if these cables would work at all, though most uncertified cables I have seen and used have at least permitted the phone to be charged. Only one way to find out – I plugged my phone into my computer using one of the cables. My phone immediately started charging and my computer was able to access the storage in my phone. That’s really all there is to it, they work.<br /><br />The cable is shielded in a nylon weave and is terminated on both ends with a hard plastic plug with a sleeve before capping in an aluminum casing. They seem to be made well and hopefully should last a while.<br /><br />The price is good, too, considerably cheaper than Apple-branded cables.<br /><br />So far, I have no complaints with these cables.

5.0,Works Well,"I have worked with a number of power banks like this one, and all of them are similar in concept and basic function though they vary in capacity, number of ports, included accessories like carabiners and other features. This is one of the larger-capacity packs with which I have worked and so far I have not had any issues with it. It appears to be a solid workhorse.<br /><br />At the heart of any of these battery packs is a set of rechargeable batteries, which is where these things get their weight. Generally speaking, the heavier the power bank the more batteries and more capacity the bank possesses. This one is no exception to that. At a capacity of 25,000 mA, this is a bit of a brute and has some heft to it. That said, it is slightly smaller and lighter than most of the higher-capacity units I have used.<br /><br />It’s a handsome fellow and looks quite a bit like a smart phone.<br /><br />There are two output ports for charging USB devices. One of them is rated for 5V/1A and the other is at 5V/2.1A. This does not mean that when you plug in a tablet or phone that it will steadily output a full 1A or 2.1A. Putting a USB power meter on the ports when charging my phone on the 1A port, the power fluctuates, especially if I am actually doing things on my phone at the time. When “at rest”, my phone typically draws about 0.5A, but when I open an app or open a web page in the browser, it spikes and will pull quite a bit more but then it settles again.<br /><br />I have not drained this pack completely yet so I am not sure how many charges I can get with it when it comes to my phone. My phone can be charged from dead to 100% on a pack that has a 2,500 mA capacity, so in theory this one should be capable of giving me 10 full charges between needing to be recharged itself. We’ll see. It does get my phone charged up relatively quickly, and it shows its own capacity while it is charging so I’ll know when it is getting low.<br /><br />So far, I have no complaints with this battery pack and I am pleased with it. It looks nice, it has a very high capacity and it works as advertised.",[],B07PFMJ3XG,B07PFMJ3XG,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2019-04-10 08:06:13.342,0,False,Read This Excellent Book to Increase in Wisdom and Knowledge!
5.0,Exceeded My Expectations,"I have used a number of different phone holders of different types, but this is the first one I have used that is mounted on the air vent. I have avoided this type of holder up to this point because I did not trust that they would hold well or would constantly force the vent to point downward from the weight of the holder. Summer is upon us, and I have had repeated problems with my phone overheating and shutting down so I decided to try this holder to see if it would help with that problem specifically. Now I wish I had been using this type of holder all along; it has proven to be far and away better than I expected.<br /><br />I will start by saying that my concerns with this type of holder seem to be unfounded. The holder does keep the vent open which is ok, and there is a little bit of play in the vent itself in terms of being able to move the fins, but the holder stays put and when attached properly it holds securely.<br /><br />Most spring-loaded holders with which I have worked use a spring to clamp closed on the devices they hold, but this one works in the opposite way. To close, the clamp must be manually closed and squeezed against the phone to secure the phone, and the button on the holder causes the clamp to pop open. This isn't a problem, it's just different than what I have seen before now.<br /><br />So, with the temperature close to 100 F in the car, I clamped the phone in place and cranked up the AC. I made two important observations. First, the holder was not as disruptive to air flow as I had thought it would be. Yes, it does block a good bit of air from direct flow but it does not close the vent or keep air from flowing, so it did not impact how well the car's AC worked. Second, even with the sun beating down on the phone, the phone was cooled enough by the AC to be cool to the touch and it never shut down on me.<br /><br />This phone holder solved an important issue for me and cleared up some of the misunderstandings I had about air vent mounts. It works well for me and it allows me to keep my phone alive when other solutions failed me. This is an easy product to recommend based on my experience with it.",[],B07SN3DKSV,B0C2PCFMKB,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2019-07-18 10:56:19.635,0,False,Some great ideas
5.0,Works Well and Competitively Priced,"I selected this phone mounting system specifically because it comes with a vent mount and I have had problems with my phone getting too hot on the dashboard. The one I had been using broke and could not be repaired so I needed a new one, and this one seemed like a reasonable solution. So far, I am very pleased with it. It seems to be well-made and it holds the phone very well. The cost is a plus as well.<br /><br />There are two ways to mount your phone with this unit – either using the suction mount or with the ventilation mount. Most people will probably use the suction mount, and as far as that goes the suction mount is better than many I have used. The suction cup itself is one of the sticky types that gives it additional adhesion to smooth surfaces, a huge plus when mounting on the windshield. Because of the stickiness, it is a lot less likely to release when the window gets cold in the wintertime. The vent mount is very typical and is a basic pincer mechanism that uses a wingnut/screw to tighten. The good news is that you don’t have to choose just one or the other because the ball and socket connector allows for moving the actual harness between the two. So, if you have two vehicles, you only need one unit without needing to move the whole thing and you can leave the suction cup in place.<br /><br />The harness itself works like a standard car mount solution – drop in the phone and squeeze the sides together against the phone. Press a button to make it let go of the phone. Adjust the bottom support bracket for larger phones. This is not rocket science. What is different, though, is that the release is more of a soft mechanism instead of an abrupt open that slams immediately to completely open. When the release button is pressed the harness opens gently. That will reduce stress and wear, though I never had a problem with any harness breaking in the past because of this.<br /><br />I put the phone in the harness, closed the harness snugly and then inverted the whole thing and shook it very vigorously. The phone didn’t come out and didn’t even wiggle. That’s a very good sign that the harness won’t accidentally let your phone fall if secured properly. While not a road/vibration test, it is more than enough to make the point that this harness will keep your phone secure.<br /><br />Finally, there’s the cost. I have seen a lot of harnesses that are of lower quality that cost more and don’t come with the ventilation mount. This one is priced competitively.<br /><br />So far I have zero complaints. I am not a typical user in that I favor the ventilation mount, though the suction mount is well made and will keep your phone secured. The harness is above average and does a very good job of holding the phone in place. And finally, the asking price is very reasonable.",[],B088WZ6588,B0C57J2P19,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2020-07-18 17:23:45.107,9,False,Love this Penn Cage Series (Greg Iles)
5.0,Solid Vent-Based Mounting System,"I go through phone mounts for the car at a rate of about one every year. My preference in mounts is actually vent mounts because the AC coming out of the vent keeps the phone cooler (I have had problems with the phone overheating in the car on occasion and mounting over the vent helps tremendously). I have used other Andobil phone mounts and looked to this one to fill the need since my last mount broke. So far I’m pleased with it.<br /><br />This mount is a typical ball/socket mount for the vent, but there are two different vent attachments for it. One is a typical pincer-type that grips via rubber-padded fins that work somewhat like disk brakes. The other is a type I have never before seen and works by a retractable hook designed to hold tight against the back of the vent fin, without a friction grip.<br /><br />The pincer grip works about as expected. It has a wingnut-style tightener that slowly closes the fins together until they form a good, firm grip on one of the fins in the vent. If you haven’t worked with this type of mount, I offer a word of caution from experience – do not overtighten, because enough tension will cause the fins to crack and break which ruins the mount.<br /><br />The other mount works on a worm gear style of mechanism (if it’s not a worm gear, it works like one). A turning sleeve slowly retracts the hooked arm until it catches and holds snugly against the vent. It has a couple of splayed feet that provide support against either the rest of the vent or the dashboard depending on how it is positioned.<br /><br />From experience with other Andobil mounts, I would recommend putting a drop of lubricating oil on the ball to help prevent the socket from seizing. The rubber gasket in the socket has a tendency to stick to the ball, which is an issue if you want to make an adjustment to the position.<br /><br />The holding bracket for the phone itself is well designed. Some brackets snap open abruptly when opened, but this one opens gently which produces less wear and tear on the inner workings. It accommodates my phone just fine (an older iPhone 6) but it also is large enough to handle larger models without difficulty. The bracket holds securely and I have had no problem with my phone shifting or slipping, even when I have slapped my phone in hastily without paying attention.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice vent mount for the phone. It holds well and it has a different mounting mechanism that seems to work better than the normal pincer type, though it comes with a pincer mount too if that is preferred. If you like vent mounts for the phone (and in my case, such is my very best option), this is one to consider.",[],B08SWLYYSL,B08SWLYYSL,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2021-05-08 13:37:53.746,0,False,Entertaining book about the entertainment industry
4.0,High Capacity at a Great Price Point; Slow to Replenish,"I use battery packs like this one to charge my phone all the time; I’ve learned that plugging my phone into the wall and letting it charge continuously shortens the battery life, while a battery pack cuts off when the charge is finished. This is the highest capacity charger I have seen and used and so far I am happy with it, though I do have one complaint with it.<br /><br />Most packs I have used top out around 10,000mA (some have been higher) and are good enough to charge my phone 3-4 times before needing to be plugged in to replenish. This one is 30,000mA and I believe I can get around 10-12 charges from it before I need to plug it in and charge it back up. That’s a huge difference. I say “believe” because I have not drained it all the way to nothing yet, but so far that seems to be about right.<br /><br />This thing has a good-sized solar cell and it helps in keeping the charge up. That said, do not expect it to charge at the same rate via solar cell as it does when it’s plugged in. On average I have noticed most solar packs take roughly 4 times longer to charge with just solar as compared to using USB.<br /><br />This unit plugs in via USB-C for charging and this is faster than using MicroUSB. Now that said, this is not a fast-charging device, at least when replenishing the pack. When I received it I immediately plugged it in and it showed it was roughly half charged. It took several hours to reach full capacity. Using the port to charge a tablet the charge speed it fine, though. Being a larger pack it will obviously take longer to charge up than a smaller one, but I was surprised at how long the charge takes, considering the USB-C charging port. Fortunately I have not needed to charge it from empty yet.<br /><br />Included is an LED flashlight bank that is good for emergency use. I don’t make a habit of using such, but it’s a nice-to-have.<br /><br />One word of caution I offer if you have used other cells like this one – this one is heavier than is typical, which is a function of the capacity due to bigger battery storage. If traveling light is more important than having battery power, this is something to keep in mind. The include carabiner is very helpful and allows for clipping this pack to a backpack, belt or other otherwise unused loop or hook.<br /><br />The price is the big bonus with this pack. I have seen packs that cost more that have less features and less capacity, so this pack is a bargain considering the price point.<br /><br />Other than the slow recharge, this is a great pack that will see a lot of use in my house. I love the capacity and I like that I can leave it on the window sill to keep charging when not in use. The price point is excellent, considering the capacity. If you need capacity and the weight isn’t a concern, this is one to definitely consider.",[],B08YRQ5WLG,B08YRQ5WLG,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2021-05-27 11:41:51.668,0,False,Many beautiful lines come from a young man
5.0,Solid Basic Phone Case,"It has been a while since I have had an Otterbox phone case. I recently upgraded my phone and wanted a basic clear case for it, and I chose this one. So far I am happy with it.<br /><br />This is a basic, no-frills case for the iPhone 13. As mentioned I chose the clear case and it is very much that - it is not frosted or opaque like another case I have but is absolutely clear.<br /><br />The case is designed for bumper shocks more than anything and it delivers. It has a thick, semi-pliable bumper guard as well as a fair amount of thickness on the back so your phone is well protected. It does a good job with medium height drops and fumbles and it keeps the phone for getting scratched up when jammed in a pocket of briefcase.<br /><br />The button covers work well and the phone is as operable as if I put no case on it at all. I have had no issues with unresponsive buttons related to this case. The speaker, microphone and lightning ports all line up nicely on the bottom as well and the case does not interfere with any of these. Finally, the case comes to the perimeter of the screen but does not actually touch the screen so it does not interfere with screen covers - I major issue I have seen with a few cheap cases in the past.<br /><br />I am pleased with this case and expect to get years of service from it. It provides good protection for the phone and it does not interfere with the phone's operation at all.",[],B09D5DCTRH,B0C43WL6VV,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2022-08-01 10:13:06.315,0,False,Extraordinary historical fictional account of Lodz Ghetto
5.0,Decent Flap Case for iPhone 13,"I had a case similar to this one for my iPhone 6 and I really came to appreciate it. It was convenient to have the necessary cards with my phone without having to carry a separate wallet. I wanted a similar case for my iPhone 13 and I found this one. It's not perfect but it answers the need I have and I am happy with it.<br /><br />This is a basic flap case with three card holder and one ID holder. It does add a little bulk to the phone when the phone is in it, but it still fits nicely in my pocket. Contact magnets keep the flap closed so nothing shakes loose.<br /><br />One of the features this case claims is RFID protection. I decided to test that on the card readers at work, which are very sensitive and can read my badge from over a foot away. With my badge in this case the reader could still scan it, but it had to be about 2"" from the sensor before it would pick up. That's on par with the large majority of RFID wallets I have tried. I have seen better, but I have also seen worse. For most people, this is sufficient protection for preventing scans from any practical distance.<br /><br />The case seems to be made well and I haven't noticed any problems with the material separating or being assembled incorrectly. Time will tell how well it holds up.<br /><br />The one area where I think this case could use some improvement is in the number of card pockets. It can hold only a total of 4 credit cards (or 3 + 1 ID card). That may be enough for some, but I need a couple more slots. Adding more would cause the case to add much more bulk, and the flap would not close either, so this is probably as close to perfect as I will find.<br /><br />As I write this, the asking price is about $20, which is reasonable.<br /><br />This is the type of phone case I wanted and it meets the need I have. It looks nice, it holds a few cards for me so I don't need to pack a separate wallet, and it offers basic RFID protection for those cards. The asking price is reasonable too. If you have an iPhone 13 and you want a case that can hold a couple of credit cards, this is one to consider.",[],B0BPRNYJ4B,B0BTHHJGPX,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,2023-02-08 11:01:55.541,1,False,Sonderkomando story in Auschwitz

5.0,Really nice wallet case but unfortunately can't use QI charger unless I take my cards out,"I had previously been using an otter box wallet case for all of my phones up until the S 20, however the version for the S 20 had terrible reviews that the S 20 kept falling out of it. Thus, I was suddenly in the market for a new type of wallet case.<br /><br />This has a different form factor that I am used to, with the cards on the back of the phone, and I wasn't convinced at the beginning that my cards would stay put. However, after testing this for a solid month, they have stayed put and I've been really impressed. The phone has a nice protective ridge around the front so that when I drop my phone, it has some level of protection. And the case is easy to hold, fits around my phone perfectly, and has presented no issues, except for the QI charging.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the cards are placed in such a way that if I have my ID and an ATM card in the slots as directed, I can't QI charge. This leads to me removing my cards and then forgetting them, which is exactly what I don't want and the whole point of having a wallet case for me.<br /><br />However, when I use a cord to charge and just leave my cards in there, this is a really comfortable, ideal case that is pleasant to use. I like that the sides have a grippy texture that means that sweaty fingers are unlikely to drop the phone, and the overall form factor is quite nice. Definitely the cardholders are very effective and it's easy to get what I need out of the slots, without them falling out when I don't want that.<br /><br />Overall this is a nicely designed case for people who use a cord to charge.",[],B083L9MFMD,B084J4WJ1P,AFPF2CONJ33FNFKOEQ2TUNWQJTFQ,2020-09-25 16:11:56.163,0,False,Good book for vintage penmanship instruction

I've had to contact my cell phone company three times now to reset the phone, which involves me removing the sim card, and turning it off while they do that from their end. When I asked how to avoid doing this, they said buy a new phone. How disappointing!!! I would not recommend this phone for that reason, for not making calls (see above), for not being loud enough for voicemails, for saying that my contacts to call do not exist when they do, for calls not going through -they dial and hang up.

4.0,"Really cheap plastic, but the screen part works well","I wanted to try this out for my husband. He had a stroke that left him with limited use of his left hand, so it is hard for him to hold his phone long enough to watch videos.<br /><br />First off, know that this is made of incredibly cheap, thin plastic. All of the mfg money must have been put into the magnifier screen. It feels like it will fall apart at any moment.<br /><br />But the actual magnification screen actually works very well. It turns a small phone screen into a screen about the size visually of a portable dvd player.<br /><br />My husband had a lot of trouble getting his phone to stay in place with the thin plastic flap on the tray part. He got around this by using a different metal phone holder (also purchased on Amazon) to hold his phone in place and moving the screen in front of it.<br /><br />In my opinion, they have a good thing going with this screen magnifier, but it could be very good if they used thicker plastic on the rest of the unit. It would be worth a couple bucks more to get a version that is more stable and sturdy.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710X+8MStjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710X+8MStjL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710X+8MStjL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dwgz1vrlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dwgz1vrlL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dwgz1vrlL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-vUiS1p0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-vUiS1p0L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-vUiS1p0L._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Ba4QG6hLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Ba4QG6hLL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Ba4QG6hLL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xV4wYx8wL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xV4wYx8wL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xV4wYx8wL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B08L6WH1QJ,B08L6W5Q4K,AFTEMMCIMU62ONZHLLXEXSME4Z6Q,2020-12-26 08:07:42.311,1,False,Too dark and violent for me

3.0,Heavy!,"I switched from the Amazon Fire line of tablets which kept failing on me (4 in one year) and found the Lenovo tablet in my price range. At the time I bought the tablet there were very few covers available. I bought another model from this same company. It was horrible and I returned it. This became available and I jumped at the chance. The biggest issue is the weight, this is over 8 ounces, half the weight of the tablet. It really bulks  up your lightweight table badly and that's disappointing. But it does a decent job of protecting the tablet. The case has magnets which turn the tablet on and off as you open it. Problem there is the way the case configures it covers the rear camera port so they put in a creased corner you can flop down and use the camera with the cover back. This corner also has magnets in it. They should have been left out of this section because it's so floppy it won't stay closed so it's constantly turning the table on and off as the case gets moved around. This is truly annoying though far less annoying than the cover I returned. I'm not 100% happy with this but it was necessary because the tablet was too slippery without a case. I'll live with it.",[],B089YCNSC8,B089YCNSC8,AFUSWNVA72MMWHGYWJ652SYX2JJQ,2020-09-27 20:46:45.762,1,False,Versatile book with photos and recipes

5.0,Neat little fast charger,"[[VIDEOID:1610c6ad3b0203a9eeccb968991a85b4]] With Apple leading the way to not including a charger with their phones, it's become necessary to invest in a good charger as part of your phone purchase.  I have personal gripes about their claims of it being more environmentally friendly, but I'll leave that out of this review.<br /><br />With that said, let's talk about this Type-C fast charger.  It supports 35W PD over Type-C.  On a Pixel 7 phone, it will support the maximum charging speed at 20W of power with power to spare.<br /><br />While it's compact, it unfortunately still takes up an extra plug space on my power strip.  The folding prongs makes this charger great for travel as it is super compact and just looks neat.  This is power and style in one package.<br /><br />This is a secondary charger that I keep in my bedroom and it works perfectly for what I need.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K8SBdcreL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K8SBdcreL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K8SBdcreL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615EU5GgUUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615EU5GgUUL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615EU5GgUUL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XBDYBm84L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XBDYBm84L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XBDYBm84L._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0B7HWSZZJ,B0BLSLFGT9,AFXAMSEN6MT4WQHSXCV4JRGXWODA,2022-11-12 19:20:28.603,11,False,"What doesn't break you, will make you stronger. 3.5 to 4 stars"
4.0,Lovely band that has so many conveniences.,"I really do love this watch band.  I pair it with my Galaxy Watch 4, although the listing says that it is for Galaxy Watch 5.  That's not to say there aren't issues with it, though...<br /><br />So instead of going for the sure thing that is the black silicone band, I went for the blue.  I think it really makes the watch stand out on my wrist.  The silicone is soft with a satin finish that is comfortable against my skin.<br /><br />This band has many nice features.  The soft silicone, as I said, is comfortable and flexible.  The clasp mechanism is a quick release that lets you take of the watch very easily.  To adjust the length of the band, there is a little lock on the clasp that allows you to adjust the band, then close the lock and the band stays in place.  This means that the band is infinitely adjustable so that you can get the perfect fit.  The clasp mechanism is magnetic, which is fine for the most part.  Magnets make is easy to clasp and unclasp the watch.<br /><br />So here's the big problem with this band:  The magnetic clasp.  While it is very convenient, it does come off.  I haven't had any issues with it coming apart during day-to-day use, but when I'm active (playing tennis), I do find that it comes apart.  Being silicone, this really should be considered a sports band and if the thing comes apart while playing sports, it kinda defeats the purpose.  I'll probably need to have a little velcro band or rubber band to keep the clasp closed when I play sports.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SSAfCXdAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SSAfCXdAL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SSAfCXdAL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eO6Dl6jDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eO6Dl6jDL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eO6Dl6jDL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vcYEu47dL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vcYEu47dL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vcYEu47dL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0BG4LY5PQ,B0BG4MDS5L,AFXAMSEN6MT4WQHSXCV4JRGXWODA,2022-11-18 22:38:49.445,0,False,"Small town, big secrets. 3 to 3.5 stars"
5.0,A slim iPhone 14 case with a silky feel and a built in ring/holder,"[[VIDEOID:66092c961c39bff86f0c9349a84e5066]] When it comes to phone protection, I strike a balance between bulkiness and protection.  I opt for a slim case to keep the phone small, then I add a tempered glass screen protector for the front and it generally protects my phone well enough.  Including protection from falls and scratches.<br /><br />Thomo Compatible with iPhone 14 Case is just the kind of case that I like.  It is slim at perhaps 1/8 inch thickness all around, made from silicone and lined with a soft felt so there's no danger of scratching the phone while taking it on/off.<br /><br />The silicone case itself has a silky texture that gives it a high-end feel and the color isn't well-represented in my pictures is a nice, dark maroon.<br /><br />Add to this, the built-in ring that I usually have to add to my phones to give me better grip so that there's even less chance for me to drop it.  Of course, the ring also serves as a kickstand for video watching.<br /><br />Now while most cases just come in a box, Thomo tried to set themselves apart by including a nice letter with little blurbs written by various people in their company.  It's a nice touch that gives the impression that they care.  The included sticker is nice too.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Yql84S-cL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Yql84S-cL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Yql84S-cL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hu9rPjevL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hu9rPjevL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hu9rPjevL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0B3RHW35R,B0BYCD42J8,AFXAMSEN6MT4WQHSXCV4JRGXWODA,2023-01-05 16:45:07.673,1,False,"Everyone is of value, & our elders have wisdom to offer"

The only one it is a bit touchy on is my LG Notebook as I have to press harder on that screen. On the other three devices all stylus tips are extremely responsive. The only negative is that to get to the pen or the clear tip, one has to unscrew the chamber. Other than this, I love this better than a previous stylus I was using.<br /><br />On the interior of the cylinder is a ballpoint pen and a clear disk tip. On either end of the exterior, is a rubber tip and fiber mesh tip. One replacement tip for each of the four types is provided (see plastic bag in photos 1 & 2). Based on my tests, I do not feel one tip is better over the other. I was able to work with all of them. I personally prefer the rubber or fiber tips over the clear one but none have perfect precision (see last photo). They are just all good enough for what I need this for.<br /><br />In addition to the extra set of tips, it also comes with a fake leather sleeve.

5.0,Definitely a great buy,I actually wasn’t going to buy it because it’s rather pricey but after buying 3 smaller ones and having to charge them constantly for one charge to my phone I finally splurged after a friend of mine recommended it. I love it! The charge lasts forever and I can charge my phone at least 3 times without having to charge it back up. It’s heavier than what I’d like but honestly that doesn’t bother me. I’d buy it again but I don’t think I’ll have to. Seems like it’s going to last a long time. My only complaint is that the charging cords are a little short so that I have to hold the phone and the charger at a weird angle or it seems the cord won’t last long. Would be better if they were a little longer so that they could bend and give more leeway for the phone.

The trade-off for protection is worth it, and I don't think any other tempered glass protector would be any better.

5.0,Solid peformer and full featured for an entry level smart phone,"I purchased this phone on a two year contract direct from Verizon so am going to focus on the phone without commenting on price, which here is different from the deal that I received.<br /><br />I have had bad experiences with HTC in the past and have been more of a Samsung fan. However, this phone has exceeded my expectations. While I love the Samsung's Note series and have gone through the 2, 3 and 4, this phone is surprisingly close. The difference is the user interface and battery life. The interface is subjective, but the battery life is not in the same league as the Samsung Note 4. On the other hand, this phone has the same solid signal reception as the Samsung, and is every bit as intuitive to use.<br /><br />The screen is easy to read, and photos and video are decent (although not spectacular). Considering that this is more of an entry level phone, however, it is truly packed with features and is fast with web browsing and other network functions. While this is not super quick with games, for regular use it is plenty fast.<br /><br />I added a 32GB SD card, which more than compensated for the relatively small phone's internal memory, and person who I added to my plan and who is using this phone is thrilled.<br /><br />If you are looking for a full featured smartphone at an entry level price, this one - direct from Verizon - is a decent and solid phone that is easy to use. To be sure, it is not a Samsung, but it's darn close.",[],B00O5EQRS6,B00O5EQRS6,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-02-29 05:40:40.000,2,False,Truly Meaningful
5.0,"Will support a Note 4 in an Otterbox Defender case, but read my caveats","I received this as a free review sample. The reason for five [solid] stars is this tiny holder firmly supports my Note 4 phone and its bulky [[ASIN:B00NF4SXSO OtterBox Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Case Defender Series]]. I would never thought!<br /><br />The holder was easily affixed to my 2014 Outlander's vent and did not budge either. I will say that this will probably not work well during the winter in areas where it actually gets cold and the heater is blasting because phones, and especially batteries have an inherent hatred of heat. Take that into consideration when making a purchase decision. Where I live we use air conditioning almost year round, with some exceptions, so for most of the time this will work perfectly as a phone mount.<br /><br />Another thing to take into consideration: you can orient your phone from portrait to landscape, or any angle in between, but it cannot be tilted. In some vehicles that may be an impediment. Finally, I have not been using this long enough to determine of the powerful magnet is going to cause problems with my Note 4's S-pen, but will caution you to also take that into consideration.<br /><br />Bottom line: if this style of holder works for you, it's a safe bet that it will support your phone in most case types.",[],B01ARQPLMS,B01ARQPLMS,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-04-03 03:57:47.000,0,False,A Rare Find
5.0,Well made and perfect for cutting invasive bamboo stands,"I received these as a free review sample. Instead of beating around the bush I'll get to the reason why I gave it five stars: it will cut through bamboo, and not just shoots, but six-to-eight footers that are nearly an inch in diameter. That alone makes me love this because large areas of my property has become home to invasive bamboo that a neighbor planted and has taken over my yard as well as others in the neighborhood.<br /><br />These shears will cut through new bamboo up to eight feet tall with little effort. The operative word is 'new' because dead stands that are brown require a saw. These will also cut through brush and shrubs as fast and much easier than the other shears and trimmers I own, including long handle pruning shears.<br /><br />A final reason why I rated these so highly is the construction is first rate. I did notice a slight wobble where the pinned handles met, but the blade still seated perfectly into the channel in the opposite handle, and after using these for a full day the shears were still rock solid.  The handles are also nicely designed and easy to grip and operate for long periods - especially when cutting bamboo.<br /><br />Overall, these are well made and do a better job than other shears that I own or have used. Are they the best? Perhaps, but I cannot say for sure. I will say that they are perfect for my needs, and if I were to lose then I would not hesitate to replace them.",[],B01CP0N2LG,B01CP0N2LG,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-04-21 05:27:15.000,0,False,A Positive Message
4.0,"Poor person's iPhone 6 plus - older technology, but fast, functional and good if you are on a budget","I received this as a free review sample. My subtracted star is because the documentation is too small to adequately read. I am a fairly technical user who did not really need it, but for a non-technical person the mere act of finding the SIM slots, identifying which one to use, and how to insert the SIM card is daunting with the existing documentation. A large, single-sheet and well illustrated page would have gone a long way to making this a five star, consumer-friendly phone.<br /><br />Note: this is two versions of Android behind, but for me that is not a real issue. I am not sure if there is an upgrade path, but I do think that the KitKat version (4.4.2) that is on the phone is plenty functional for most people. The big surprise is how fast this phone is. I have been testing it for about a week with a T-Mobile card, and for web browsing where WiFi is available it is pretty close to my Note 4. YouTube video streaming is as smooth as it is on my Note 4, and other apps are just as fast. Bear in mind that I do not use apps that require fast processors, so if you are into game apps this phone may not be what you want.<br /><br />The camera for both photos and videos is pretty close to that on my Note 4 as well. The big difference between this and my [much more expensive] Note 4 is the Samsung can go a lot longer between battery charges. This phone is still decent in that area, but is nothing like the Note 4, so if you are a heavy user this aspect may be disappointing.<br /><br />Test calls were very clear in my area. I am in Central Florida and the area has excellent coverage for all of the major providers. Again, I would rate this as about on par with my Note 4 for making and receiving phone calls, but that is not exactly apples-to-apples since my Note 4 is on Verizon's 4G network and this phone is currently using T-Mobile's GSM service.<br /><br />This phone will accept micro SD cards up to 64GB, which does not completely meet my personal needs, but is probably more than enough for most people. The only other real issue other than the documentation shortcoming I mentioned above is the charging port on the phone requires a charging cable with a longer than normal micro USB end. The cable that ships with this phone has that end. If you want a spare, you can find cables that have that type of end, such as the [[ASIN:B00O7KPVEO Cellet Extra Long 8mm Tip Micro USB Charging/Data Sync Male Cable]].  I recommend purchasing one of those also.<br /><br />Basically this is a budget-priced smart phone that is approximately the same size as an iPhone 6 plus or Samsung Note series. It does not have the latest and greatest operating system or other features, but is still pretty fast and functional. For basic calling, web browsing, social networking and the such it is a great solution. For power users or folks who need (or want) the latest and greatest, this is probably not what you want.",[],B0123MHMZI,B0123MHMZI,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-06-15 12:33:14.000,1,False,A Travel Adventure For Those Who Love to Live Vicariously
5.0,"Works as well as other brands, but more comfortable","I received this as a free review sample. I've been using this for a few days (alternating among other compression socks from a different brand.) This pair is as effective as the other brand in managing swelling in my left leg from a trauma, but is vastly more comfortable.<br /><br />What I love about these versus the other is the way it breathes. Given that I live in a hot, humid place (and it's summer as I write this) that alone inspired me to rate it so highly. It's machine washable (I use cold/cold and regular cycle), which is another plus. Do note the product specs on this page because these are a blend of merino wool and synthetics.<br /><br />The compression aspect is equal to the other socks I use. I cannot honestly tell the difference one way or the other in that regard.<br /><br />Bottom line: you can have both compression AND comfort with these. Mine fit just as the chart indicated, so as long as you carefully measure per the product photos and description, then order the corresponding size in the chart, you should be happy with these socks.",[],B01CXLJTS2,B01CXLJTS2,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2016-06-29 16:19:48.000,0,False,A Thoughtful Gift Anyone Will Love!
5.0,"Only works with vehicles with 3.5mm AUX ports, but also works with most home stereo gear","I received mine as a free review sample. Note: if you are purchasing this for a vehicle the sound system must have a 3.5mm AUX port for this receiver to work. Many older vehicles do not have that port. If your vehicle lacks one, a better solution would be a bluetooth receiver that connects to your vehicle system using an FM radio signal.<br /><br />This is not limited to vehicle use. I am using mine to add bluetooth capability to a [[ASIN:B0077AMSNI Samson Expedition XP150 150-Watt Portable PA]], which has a 3.5mm input channel. I power this unit from a regular 1A USB power supply like those that come with most phones and tablets.<br /><br />Pairing and connecting from my Note 4 phone or Samsung tablet are easy. This goes into pairing mode when powered on, and I have not had any issues streaming music and backing tracks through it. I normally do not use the hands-free function, but I did test it and incoming and outgoing calls are clear and noise free.<br /><br />Bottom line: in my opinion, this is not as ideal as the FM solution I mentioned above for vehicles because of the need for a 3.5mm AUX port. However, for home stereo and on stage connections, this is perfect because even if your PA, amp or received only has RCA inputs, you can connect this device to them using an adapter such as [[ASIN:B000I23TTE C&E 30S1-01260 2 x RCA Male, 1 x 3.5mm Stereo Female, Y-Cable 6-Inch Gold Plated Connector]] or directly into the unit's AUX jack it it has one.

If you are folding bills it will hold about five comfortably.<br /><br />The exterior provides good padding front and back if you accidentally drop your phone, and the holder into which you snap your phone adds a little more protection.<br /><br />My rating is mainly based on value for money. At the Verizon store where I purchased the phone a plain, bumper type holder was priced at nearly four times what this cost. Considering that those cases go for a few bucks here or other online sellers it's plain to see the value in this case.<br /><br />I did not rate this for durability because I have only had it for a week, but I am guessing that it will easily outlast the phone itself which (in my experience) dies before the contract runs out because of failures in fixed batteries.",[],B07SFVNV9G,B07SFVNV9G,AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,2019-12-01 17:18:16.341,0,True,"Funny, good tips, totally worth reading!"

5.0,LG G4 case is a perfect fit and it's attractive,"I recently had my LG G4 repaired and decided to purchase a new case for the phone with its new innards.  This is superior to my previous case in fit, durability and attractive color combination,  Included is a screen protective sheet and concise instructions for putting the case onto the phone.  In order to get a proper fit and save the case, be sure to remove the hard plastic shell from the flexible case.  Move the little flaps at the bottom a few times to get them used to being moved and then slip it onto your phone.  Now snap the harder shell onto the phone, clicking it into the fitted spots and be sure the flaps are accessible.  I've had no problems opening and closing them to insert my charging cable or earphone miniplug and they are securely protected when I snap the flaps into the case.  A nice feature is the protection this affords to the slots which naturally have a tendency to develop a dust or dirt accumulation.  The colors of the actual case are more minty green than the yellow green of the image I see online.  The light teal is a pretty complement.  Since the LG G4 is a thinner style phone, this case does detract from its design but protecting the phone is more important to me and even with the case, its thinner than most others.  All openings are well beveled and the phone operates perfectly.  It's quite a bargain, too, since the phone is now an older and less desirable model.",[],B00X0X32P4,B00X0X32P4,AGCA64OUVM2TJGNN3IUXMEU7KF6Q,2019-09-20 19:15:25.501,0,True,Behind the scenes look at real life

My screws on the inside of the iPhone were stuck and I had to use an X-Acto knife to get them to come out. The glass Screen for the iPhone was beautiful and worked great. The screen protector that was additional came cracked (Not a big deal as it was extra in my eyes). I did need to use the X-Acto knife to cut off part of a plastic piece to make the final fit. So yes I modified the screen and instructions but ended up working great for me.<br /><br />I was very careful with all of the circuit boards and connections as recommended on the YouTube video.

5.0,Ah...home again.  :),"I like a belt-mounted horizontal carry for my phone (I can't understand people carrying these heavy things around in their pockets and, it seems to me, increasing the risk of droppage at the same time) and I found Reiko pouches years ago when they were faux leather and I had...an iPhone 4, I think? Don't remember for sure which model it was. But it was quite some time ago. I loved the Reiko's ease-of-use; with its magnetic closure and the opening in the bottom for pushing my phone up and out of the pouch, using it quickly became instinctive, reflexive - I didn't have to think about it a bit. Sheathing and unsheathing my phone was like a martial arts maneuver one has practiced endlessly (wax on, wax off!) to the point where one executes it naturally, with zero thought or effort. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the faux leather started to give up the ghost, flaking and peeling after what seemed to me not long enough a time.<br /><br />Probably partly because of this...*ahem*...flaky behavior, when I bought my iPhone XS Max I decided to consider other options, and I found the Otterbox Defender series. I came to love that, with its rotating belt clip (I could get my horizontal carry) and the ridiculous toughness of the case. Plus the case was made of a slightly soft synthetic rubber that was extremely grippy, thereby all but eliminating any fears I had of dropping my phone. (I'm not one of these people who treat their phones carelessly; when I buy a new phone I take it out of the box and put it straight into a protective case and don't take it out again for any appreciable period of time until it's time to deactivate it and sell it or trade it in, at which point the new owner gets a phone in brand-new condition and I get the most value possible from my sale or trade.)<br /><br />Anywaysss...I digress. A little. I think.<br /><br />When I bought my new iPhone 13 Pro Max, I jumped on here and went straight for the Otterbox Defender for that phone model...and read the reviews. And learned that Otterbox's quality has gone down quite a ways in the scant few years I had my XS Max, and the holster no longer holds the case securely. That being a total deal-breaker for me, I went looking for a new case and found the Smartish Gripzilla. Not quite as grippy as the old Defender case, but I think it'll prove grippy enough. And while it's less protective for it than the Defender, I think I'm going to like not having to claw open little rubber doors to flip my silence switch and plug in my Lightning cable. But!: no holster. And that's when I remembered my old flame, Reiko.<br /><br />Came back here, found the appropriate size, and pulled the proverbial trigger, and I'm very pleased with what I've received. All the features I loved back in the day - the magnetic closure, the ease of use (and the good looks) are here, and the ""feature"" I didn't love as much - the faux leather material with too short a useful lifespan - is gone, replaced with a woven nylon kind of material that I'm betting is going to wear much better than the old fake leather did. Joy!<br /><br />If you're looking for a belt holster with a horizontal carry, I do recommend these Reikos. Very nice products.<br /><br />Enjoy!",[],B099NWNDY6,B099NX3S5Q,AGCIK7B4BXDHQE3FAQ5JMIDJMKDA,2021-11-27 19:13:13.331,0,True,Fun and sweet
5.0,"Depends how you define ""grippy""","This case is serving me well. I came from an OtterBox Defender case that I had on my iPhone XS Max, which set a pretty high bar for grippiness. This case is not grippy in the soft, rubbery way that the Defender was, but it is textured and shaped in such a way as to make it about as grippy as it could be while still being made out of the material it's made out of. And speaking of the material it's made out of, I fully expect that, because it's harder than the Defender case, it's going to hold up better than the Defender did. OtterBox struck a certain balance between durability and the soft kind of grippiness I was looking for when I bought this case, and the Defender did an outstanding job for a long time, but one day it just suddenly started giving up the ghost – I'd handle my phone and come away with black stuff all over my hands because the case was disintegrating. I'm thinking that what this case foregoes in soft rubberiness it will make up for in durability. The increased hardness probably also translates into greater shock to the phone if it's dropped, but iPhones can handle a lot (and I almost never drop my phone) so I'm not overly worried about that.<br /><br />All in all I think this is probably a solid choice for an iPhone case and I expect it will hold up and protect my phone very well.<br /><br />*Update, 14 months in* - I've grown very much accustomed to this case and its hardness, and it has protected my phone (I think I've dropped my phone once in these past 14 months). It looks nice in a simple kind of way, and is comfortable in the hand, with its little indentations for your fingers. Every indication I've gotten so far is that this case will last for at least as long as I have my phone, however long that may be: as yet it shows no sign of any kind of degradation, whether dent or ding or just sort of disintegrating like the OtterBox cases eventually did. I'm thinking that, even with its hard feel in the hand, this is the perfect phone case.",[],B097QCGNN7,B0BGZ94M8G,AGCIK7B4BXDHQE3FAQ5JMIDJMKDA,2021-12-24 18:16:45.201,1,True,Food Porn with humor

The side functions are easy to use. It is easy to grasp.<br />I've had other Otterbox cases over the years from different series and this one appears to protect as well as the bulkier cases. I haven't dropped it yet so can't be 💯 sure on that point.<br />By mistake with my last phone, it was left behind on a table when we went out. I came back to the phone having been mauled by my dog. He chewed the case corners really well, cracked the glass on the front and back. Thankfully he was not able to chew thru the case and actually eat/swallow any glass.

2.0,Charge all the things!,"Update, 11/23/22:<br />After the first trip we took it on, the plug wouldn't stay in the wall and made it difficult to keep our devices charged. It would literally fall out from its own weight.<br />Now, a few months later, I come back and find it stopped working a few minutes into a charge. It's like it is not making good contact in the outlet anymore. Maybe someone else will have better luck, it worked great the first time we tried it, but it only lasted a short while. I even tried bending the pins slightly to get it to make contact. Currently, none of the USB ports are usable and I'm giving up on it.<br /><br />Original review follows:<br />Now that I have a laptop powered by PD, I was excited to need only one charging system for everything when I travel. The problem? My multi-port charging system only supported USB standard, not PD, and higher power items like a laptop require the Power Delivery format.<br />This little adapter is a perfect solution!

4.0,"Slow charging, but super convinient","Unlike another mag charger we tried, this one actually sticks on with enough force to stay in place if tumbling around in a purse. I like that you can see the ring and make sure it is lined up perfectly with your phone- in our use, my daughter's phone has a case with a ring around it to keep magnetic compatibility, and the other charger we tried didn't show you where the ring was. Unlike this one, you had to move it around until it clicked into place. This one is much easier to use and MUCH stronger! You can not only see the ring protrusion, but it practically sucks itself into the phone case if you even get close. You have to practically peel it off when you want to remove it! Nice.<br />The problem however, is that it seems to take a long time to really fully charge. It's great for backup power or to top off your phone if you're out and about, but if you want to bring your phone all the way up to 100% from dead, you probably want a wall powered charger or at least a USB PD battery bank.

5.0,"Great for a prepaid month of service, easy to set up","This kit comes with a sim and 1 month of service pre-paid. I'm not new to Red Pocket so I knew what to expect; I have 2 annual plans (available through their ebay store) that I use as emergency phones when we travel for my kids. I've always been happy with what you get for the money, and I love that you can pick your network of choice (this one being on Tmobile). I always felt like they were a well kept secret!<br />I'm so happy to see they are now selling these big (large bucket of data) plans here on Amazon for a month of service. I was able to activate the line very easily by going to the website, and popped it into a standard unlocked European gsm phone. I did give it my Galaxy S10 EMEI number first when signing up because I didn't have the phone I intended to use on me yet, but the process was so straight forward, it didn't matter, the sim activated and was ready to go. I never even put the sim card in my Galaxy phone, I put it directly into the European phone once I came home and all the internet and phone calls have been working great!<br />The service is identical to T-mobile coverage where I live, I'm told there might be pockets of places where real T-mobile users can roam on other networks to expand coverage (Tmobile often makes roaming agreements with these carriers, and that wouldn't apply here), but so far it has service everywhere that my regular T-mobile line does. It's definitely on par with other MVNOs such as Mint Mobile, both in coverage and data speed.<br />This makes a great month of service to have as a spare line for someone traveling, visiting from another country, or just to try out a switch and see if you like it to save some money. You are given an option to port your number or get a new one, no further payment is required unless you want it to use it for more than the 30 days included.

5.0,Initial impression is positive...looking forward to seeing how it holds up,"I’ve had this for 2 months and just finally installed it (I kept procrastinating because I know how time consuming and sometimes frustrating it can be to correctly install a screen protector).  I must say that at least initially, I’m impressed with the attention to detail made in creating this product and the installation process.  I’ve never had a screen protector this complicated to install, but if you take your time, it seems like the results are definitely worth it.  They really thought through everything thoroughly, from the bubble level to the weight that goes over the fingerprint sensor.  My protector looks smooth as glass, and the fingerprint sensor seems to work fine, although I was initially worried that no amount of pressure would get it to read (turns out you’re better off not trying to press your entire fingerprint on the screen when registering it).<br /><br />The plastic film that comes pre-installed on the S10 was starting to look like crap on my device (sort of defeats the purpose of having a gorilla glass screen when you have a very easily scratched plastic protector on there).  Time will tell how this holds up, but my previous experience with glass protectors saving my actual screen from near-certain scratches has been good.  I expect this to be the same but will update my review if I find otherwise.  I’m just really glad they figured out a way to add a protector to a curved screen without having to use cheap plastic film.",[],B07QD2Y4YB,B07QD2Y4YB,AGFLIHRH53IVBPABMQH5TIO5WMYQ,2019-10-12 01:44:08.244,3,True,"Devoured it every chance I had.

The screen cover took some getting used to, but I found it very responsive and hardly noticed it after a while.

I will say that getting the case on/off requires some patience - I was sure I was going to break the case or the latches at some point. And I don't use the included holster at all. Finally, while the mint & polka dot design is really cute, after a while (3 months?) all the edges showed dirt & grime.

I had a case but no screen protector.  So I got the screen repaired.  I searched for glass screen protectors.  I tried a few.

Doesn't hinder touch screen functions.  The case has 2 flappy covers for the power & head phone jack.  I'm on the fence for trimming these off.  They're annoying when dealing with your phone in the car because the access requires plucking open these covers.  Note: the head phone jack opening of the case only allows for the narrowest plugs.  Meaning that if you have audio cords to connect your phone to a stereo or car, only the skinny designed plugs fit the case opening.  Cords that have the nice metal screw on covers are too large to fit & the plug won't make connection to your phone.

5.0,Classy Meets Efficient - Love genuine leather's durability & style,"I am not sure that I can say enough good things about this case. It is absolutely perfect in my opinion. Real leather is tough and rustic. The clasp and hardware is well done, sturdy, unlike the simulated leather case I had previously that fell apart. When you open the case, there is a perfect spot for your license or a photo and card slots. The phone holder fits the phone perfectly secure and all buttons are accessible. It is also easy to remove if you do need to, without damaging the case. You can tuck some items behind the cards as well, you could even include a thin set of checks, if you happen to still use those. My favorite part is the hidden card slots on the outside pocket. I keep my debit and credit cards tucked here for added security. There are card slots on BOTH sides of this leather pull out piece. If I could find a negative to include, I guess I would say that sometimes a scratch shows up on the leather, but that's leather and to me, this is the charm and classic rustic appeal that I go for even in my cowgirl & biker boots! One last thing, I also bought another product from this seller. I decided to swap out the item for a different one.... the seller was fa-nominal with my pain in the rear request. I was delighted.

And it does have very nice feel for drawing and inking.<br /><br />My expectation for a pen comes from Wacom products, which are much more open in what you can assign. I was amazed that you can't even assign your own keystrokes - even with the aftermarket app. And really I expect keystrokes, macros, and system functions at minimum.<br /><br />Is this pen good compared with the MS pen: it seems that it is. Is this pen good compared to what I expected: it's literally useless for me apart from photography.<br /><br />I wanted to use this for annotating PDFs as I read.

I've dropped it a few times and it has protected my phone. One complaint I do have is the screen cover that comes with it is a piece of crap!! It's cloudy and super scratched and it is a new one. I did not buy a used one.  But I must say that with my otterbox I had to rip off the screen cover after about 5 months because it scratched and was hard to see my screen with it on. I recently bought 2 more of these cases just for a change up every once in awhile. Also the colors shown are not at all what you get.

I also don't believe any of the raised edges are raised enough  or designed well enough to do any protecting.<br /><br />On the positives with function - the buttons are very responsive. The corner embellishments will very likely protect the phone more than traditional fashion-only cases, so I think you could classify this case as ""fashion plus"", in that it did add some protective aspects onto a traditionally fashion-only case.<br /><br />I will be keeping it on my phone and being more careful than I normally would with a tougher case.",[],B08NSSB3H1,B08NSSB3H1,AGQDLBPCYRCSEHP2E5TNVHWUOXRA,2020-12-17 12:25:27.322,2,True,No cohesive thread from story to story.

5.0,SUPERB! If you take the time to do it right. Fits my 15.6 Yoga 730 PERFECTLY.,"I am a perfectionist. I probably spent 20 minutes cleaning and wiping my screen before I even got out the stickers and tape. Why have a bunch of dust on it to begin with?<br /><br />PRODUCT PROS & CON<br />- The front side has plastic handles which make alignment a snap. Also useful if you need to pull up the screen to release a bubble. (Slowly and carefully so you don't break it.)<br />- Fits my screen perfectly very nearly edge to edge. Maybe 1-2 mm difference on the sides. The camera cutout isn't quite centered over the lens, but it's close enough. I tested, and it does not interfere with the camera at all.<br />- Perfectly clear and smooth!<br />- Works great with my Active Pen 2. Maybe even better than without it. IMPRESSED!<br />- ONE con: For a screen this size, there should be more, larger stickers to remove dust. But scotch tape also works well.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL TIPS:<br />- Kimtech delicate task wipers leave no residue and are as close to dustless as paper wipes can be. I use them for my glasses.<br />- Good old clear scotch tape is great for picking up dust, especially around the edges of the screen.<br />- I'm running a HEPA air purifier on turbo to reduce dust in the air. Obviously not necessary, but it reduces dust landing on the screen or protector while your work.<br />- I also check the protector itself for dust after I remove the film in case any static effect draws dust to it.<br />- Work deliberately but not too slowly because dust from the air may settle if you dally.<br />- Use the plastic handles on the front to position perfectly. I worked with the screen upside down and the camera toward me and lined up with the camera then slowly lowered the protector flat.<br />- Run finger from bottom to top of the screen and be patient as seals outward. Leave it alone. Do not help it. If you get any big bubbles, use the handle to pull it back up and the squeegee thing to press them out. Really much easier to lift the screen, but be careful because you don’t want to break it.<br />- I had ZERO dust, so I was done at this point. If you have any dust, you can also lift it up again by the handles and use the dust stickers or scotch tape to remove the dust. But be careful you don't add more dust or fingerprints or break the protector.<br /><br />SUPERB! VERY PLEASED!",[],B07PP8W1MC,B07PP8W1MC,AGW2YFQE4AOEHCE747ESDJYULJMA,2020-07-12 23:09:52.902,0,True,"Good read, could have been better"

1.0,Worthless - very disappointed,"I had bought a cd mount for a different car previously, and though it had its issues it was manageable. This one does NOT hold your phone up. My phone is too heavy and causes the adjustable part of the mount to just face downward. My phone doesn’t fall off, but I can’t position it in a way where I can use it for navigation while driving. My phone just faces the floor no matter what I try. I may as well just keep my phone on my lap for navigation. I hate this one. It stays in the CD player well which is the only good thing about it. My other one (different brand and more expensive) didn’t stay in the CD player as well. But that was manageable. It only came off when we tried to take our phones off the mount. So we have to be careful how we remove our phones. Other than that it is great. That one I can position however I need so I can see my navigation while I’m driving.

3.0,Glitzy case with limited  protection,"[[VIDEOID:da0958ca0c019309d7380ec0c42e8d92]] It's often challenging to find a pretty case that offers sufficient protection for my large-screen phone. I've watched videos to see where the vulnerabilities are that cause so many large iPhone screens to crack. The center is the flex point, so it's essential to beef up the rigidity on the sides of the case. I am afraid this Kit Me out World sparkly gel case does not offer the level of protection I desire for my expensive XS max iPhone. This case is constructed with three layers that amount to nothing more than a sparkly piece of paper with a hard plastic backing and a flexible outer shell. None of the layers are aligned, and there are visible gaps, so it just looks cheap and poorly made.

4.0,Maximum protection for your expensive iPhone!,"It' waa long time between phone upgrades and I did a lot of research before choosing a case for my expensive iPhone XS Max. I knew the level of protection I required and just in case reviews and disaster test videos weren't enough to convince me, I purchased several to try before deciding on which one best suited my needs. Hands down, the SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Pro Series Case is the only case that offers the type of protection I need.<br /><br />My iPhone is an expensive investment that is subjected to bumps, bangs, and occasional drops, so I require a case that offers maximum protection because I wear it clipped onto the strap of my purse, so it's always accessible.<br /><br />Even though the Pro case makes my phone appear larger I feel confident my phone would be unharmed if it were dropped from a rooftop and run over by a truck.<br /><br />When I decided to upgrade to the iPhone 11, there was no question about which case I was going to choose. As a side note, the holster broke after 11 months on my older case, and SupCase sent me not only one but two replacements, and they arrived within three days with free shipping. Their customer service is second to none and right up there with Amazon. I very highly recommend this case!<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

2.0,** UPDATE **Folding prongs bad design,"See update below review:<br /><br />Looks can be deceiving. The ANKER USB-C 25W PD Fast Wall Charger looks well designed and sturdy, but the smallest error in calculations or the manufacturing process going awry can destroy the best of intentions.<br /><br />It was about a month after receiving the charger that I started to have issues with it working. I started to send it back then (about 6 weeks ago) , however my past experience with Anker products being reliable, at a lower price point than top of the line of electrical/electronic products and not wanting to go through the return process had me hesitate. Now it is acting up again on a more regular basis.<br /><br />The problem is that the folding of the outlet prongs don't stay set internally and the prongs fold just enough to lose contact inside the unit and then it stops charging. I have jiggled and fiddled with putting up with it for too long now. I don't feel that sending back an electrical product after using it this long is proper.<br /><br />However, I did see that even though the return window had closed, there was product support for 90 days and it was within this parameter. So I chatted with an Amazon support bot and finally had to request a call back. The Amazon live agent did a good will return on this. Not sure I should have used a 'good will' credit for such a low priced item, but I did.<br /><br />All in all I would not recommend this charger. In the future I think I will try not to get a charger with folding prongs for travel. I have plenty of these that still work and the chance of them not being made correctly and thus not working is multipled over a simple normal stationary prong.<br />*** UPDATE JAN 13 2023 ***<br />Anker saw the review that I did on this charger and the problem with the folding prongs that were defective and not allowing electricity to flow through to the charger. They reached out to me and asked if I would like a refund or replacement. This was done quite a while past any normal return period. They say that they guarantee most of their products for 18 months (I think I have this correct) but I was surprised to get such a message for an electronic product. I accepted the full refund as I had already purchased another charger without folding prongs.

I borrowed my boss' Parrott headset and while I loved the concept, I hated the feel and look of that clunky thing on my head. I started researching the best Bluetooth headsets and settled on this one. I figured I would try it and if it didn't work, I would send it back. I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />This one is comfortable enough to keep on my ear all day. It goes on easily. I hear great and others hear me perfectly without hearing a lot of background noise. The battery life is wonderful. I charge it on Friday afternoon before I leave work and it's good to go Monday morning.

It plugs directly into the wall and I can plug my phone into it and charge it while I’m moving about my house doing chores or  while it’s in my purse. It’s small and about the size of an iPhone . The multi output cables are great ! It can be used to charge just about anything ! The bright orange helps me keep track of it . I’d order this again and would feel pretty good about giving this as a gift for a loved one to make sure they can always have an emergency phone charging capacity no matter where they are !! It shows you on the front how much of a charge is still in the battery pack . I feel like it is idiot proof and extreamly user friendly. Everything being attached is pretty great too .can’t misplace cords or the charger needed to charge it . Yeah baby it’s that good !! Try it you will like it !! My kids are jelly and want one for the devices they play with on long car rides .

Break out the Gorilla glue- don't use the screws, it won't work!","I love the MOBI HANDLE however the modifications one must go through if you have a silicon case isn't reasonable- especially if that silicon case is a military grade anti-impact case. The adhesive on the handle won't adhere to silicon cases so if you have one you are instructed to use the screws included in the kit to screw on the handle without using the adhesive pad. This not a good solution because the screws are very tiny, it is nearly impossible to create holes in a silicon case (especially if it is thick) and the included screwdriver is so small you cannot place enough torque on it to drive the screws through the case into the handle. Solution? I used Gorilla Glue to adhere the handle to the case (the case only cost me $12 so I am not overly worried about harming it). Gorilla Glue will stick to anything and it did- success!

You have to press down really hard and hold it down so the numbers will take. If you don’t hold it down, the number pressed will disappear.  It’s very annoying.<br /><br />Installation<br /><br />I followed the directions but it’s not that simple.  It states to insert crown side first and not to press down using the screen protector, to use the sides of it. That didn’t work for me. I continued to insert crown side first and slowly try to align the left side of the watch. It doesn’t go on easily.  I had to use the tip of my finger and carefully lift the left side of protector away from watch and use my other hand to press down. That popped on really fast.  It scared me with the actual screen. No damage, thank god.<br /><br />In summary, the protector is very strong and durable. I do not like the difficulty of trying to press buttons.

3.0,"large lightweight phone tripod, not as adjustable or as stable as better products","Amazon is currently selling these tripods for $20, which I suppose is a reasonable price for what you get, but it is far less capable than more expensive products. The tripod is mostly plastic, which makes it lightweight and easy to carry around. There are some screws to adjust the tripod, but not as many as other products.<br /><br />While you can lock the bottom legs open, all 3 legs must be open at the same angle, so this tripod only works on flat level surfaces (like on an indoor floor or tabletop).<br /><br />The center post extends about 3 feet, but you cannot lock the individual sections so a heavier camera will cause the post to slowly droop down (not good if you are making a video). The sections of the center post are held up by pressure alone, which seems like a really poor design.  If you are using any kind of camera that weighs more than 1 pound, I advise using only the lowest center post position.<br /><br />The ball head does have a nice metal ball that rotates smoothly, but the small screw lock doesn't lock very tightly.  The build-in camera mount is mostly plastic with a non-adjustable spring clamp. The spring is pretty tight and you have to be careful to not scratch your phone when using it.

Most phone chargers these days are little cubes that you need to plug in to a wall socket or power strip, but that is inconvenient if your wall socket or power strip is hidden under a table or behind a bed (like in most hotels). This charging station conveniently has an extension cord built in. 4 USB sockets (2 x type A and 2 x type C) let you charge all your equipment at the same time. The charging speeds are pretty low if you are using all the ports, so this station is best for all-day or overnight charging.<br /><br />The advertised 45W of power is only if you are charging USB-A and USB-C devices at the same time. If you are charging 2 USB-C devices (what I usually do), they only get 10W each. This is really inadequate if you are charging a laptop (which can use 60W or more), so you need to bring a separate charger for your higher power devices. I would rate this product higher if it gave the whole 45W to the USB-C ports when the USB-A ports were not in use.<br /><br />No USB cables are included; I advise that you use high quality cables for safe and fast charging.

I also like the built-in charging cable so I don't have to worry about forgetting the cable.<br /><br />3500 mAh only charges my phone about half way (less if I am using the phone while it is charging). If you're the type of person whose phone battery is always dying an hour before you get home, this battery pack may be enough to get you the rest of the way.

I am only using the USB-C port for both input and output. According to my power meter, the USB-C port handles about 18W of power for both input and output. That isn't as fast as some other battery packs that handle 30W or more, but it is much better than older battery packs that only handle 10W. 18W is probably fine for charging a smartphone, but maybe not for a tablet or laptop that supports USB-C charging and uses more electrical power.<br /><br />I am not able to accurately confirm that the capacity is really 10000mAh, but that number seems reasonable based on the battery capacity display during my real-world use.<br /><br />I do not like that this battery does not have any independent USA electrical safety certifications printed on the device, like the UL or ETL certifications that I see on many name-brand battery packs.

Just nothing sharp!<br />I did my water test with my camera as it is waterproof just in case. I let it stay in the sink of water for about 5 minutes, it kept floating so I would turn and dunk and swish it. It stayed dry!!!!

4.0,"Good Product, Just Falling Short of Greatness","First, vacillated between 4 and 5 stars.  4.5 might be about right, but I rounded up.<br /><br />Pros: quality is good, very, very close to full coverage on the phone.  Works with my Otterbox Commuter case - which &#34;just&#34; covers the top edge.  Cleaning materials were supplied along with dust spot remover/hinges.  I didn't really look closely at the glass, but it does appear to match the curve in the screen - so I shouldn't break it at the edge like my last one (installed by Verizon, don't know brand).  I did end up with one bit of dust - my fault, no reflection on the product.<br /><br />Cons: OK, why is it necessary to have the blacked out areas on the protector?  A skinny black border is OK, but WTF are you blacking out the non-screen areas?  Now, between my case and the screen protector, my 'platinum gold' S7 might as well be all black.  Additionally, the &#34;icons&#34; for the virtual buttons at the bottom of the screen are a total b*tch to align.  My are close, but not exact.  As far as I can tell, this is completely unnecessary, complicates needlessly the installation and makes my phone look dorky with a platinum gold physical button in a sea of black.<br /><br />When you come to your senses and just make this thing completely clear (which will reduce production expense - right?), please send me one.<br /><br />Now I've irritated myself.

EVERYONE I called, when talking to them on speakerphone said the same thing:  They heard an echo on THEMSELVES only when they spoke.  When I spoke, they could hear me with no echo.  When they spoke, they heard an echo.  I heard no echo either way at my end and it didn't matter what the speakerphone volume was for this to occur.<br /><br />After over an hour with Apple Support, trying all sorts of things, the rep said, try taking off the case. And that fixed it!  So, rather than return the case, I cut out the two spots on the bottom of the case that cover the speaker holes on the bottom of the iPhone 2020 SE, and that stopped the echo while still using this case.<br /><br />Hope this helps others with this rather unusual issue, with this specific case when used with the 2020 iPhone SE",[],B07SSYSM6C,B07SSYSM6C,AHJOKJQEYWRJQSWYGDWUFLUPQUUQ,2020-06-02 00:45:35.358,2,True,"Roses are red, Kindles are pink?"

Now anyone can use it to charge their phone in an emergency regardless of the type.  It is also less bulky and easier to use on my lights.

3.0,"A fairly good phone, just a few things to make it a leading phone in the mid-price class.","First the pros. It has a stylus and it cost 1/4 as much as the only others that do.  Long battery life. Lots of memory. Relatively clean software, free of excessive bloatware. Moto retained a mini headphone jack, helpful with plugging into my truck's stereo, via aux in. Lots of storage. Decent camera and photos.<br /><br />Now the cons. This phone is FRAGILE, don't even THINK about going caseless, and make it a good quality one at that with military drop specs. I dropped mine without a case 3 days into ownership. It literally shattered to pieces. 1st time ever I had a phone do that. So, case it up, and be careful with it. No Screencast, you don't realize how often you used and like that feature until you can't do it. No NFC... so you can't use google pay or other phone tap pay terminals. Not a big deal? Well, I forgot my wallet once, it sure was great to use my phone to get Gas, and lunch, 40 miles my home, and wallet left behind.  Only 2 software upgrades. (I learned post-sale about this, otherwise, I wouldn't be writing the review as a buyer)  That is unacceptable. Furthermore, let's see how long, or even if, Moto updates this phone which has the new Verizon UW and AT&T uber-fast 5G bands. Because right now, it's no faster showing 5G, than my Samsung Note 8 it replaced with only 4G was. The phone doesn't support wireless charging, I know... Really? It's a shame they skimped on so many key features and limit future upgrades, otherwise, it would be a winner at its price point.

4.0,"Great Power Bank, But Solar Charging Not Great","I have been trying to get some power banks to help us in times of power outages which we get now and then.  This power bank has some good features and one that is not so great.<br /><br />SIZE<br />This is a substantial sized power bank.  It is not oversized, but it is not tiny either.<br /><br />PLUGS<br />I love the 3 different plug styles on this.  This will allow for recharging of Type c mini usb and lightning items.  The plugs tuck right into the unit which I LOVE<br /><br />CHARGING IN OUTLET<br />This charges pretty well in an outlet taking several hours at least to fully charge.  When charging with electrical outlet, there is no green light, just the blue ones flashing until it is full.<br /><br />CHARGING IN SUNLIGHT<br />Forget it.  This is ridiculously horrible when it comes to solar charging.  I have had this charging for DAYS in the light and it stays at the same level of stored power.  When the sunlight is charging it, there is a green light lit.<br /><br />CAN YOU CHARGE MORE THAN ONE ITEM AT THE SAME TIME?<br />I have charged both a bluetooth speaker and a Motorola Power phone at the same time.  One is mini USB and the other is Type C.  They charged up well, although they were slower than if one item at a time was charging.<br /><br />POWER DRAW<br />When using this bank full to charge up 2 cell phones and a large speaker, there was still half a power bank full of charge left.<br /><br />FLASHLIGHT<br />Although I usually don't use things like this for light, in an emergency it is handy to have.  This is a very bright light.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I love this power bank for the attached plugs, the nice amount of power it has, and the bright light.  The solar part is a fail for me.  I would hate to depend on this in an emergency.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  This is fabulous without the solar panel.  I have to take a star off for the solar panel being almost silly in my experience.  It really is not worth listing in features as it does very little.",[],B08L4DSWKY,B0C786DR9T,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,2020-12-28 22:37:33.571,4,False,Not as funny or natural as her older books
5.0,"Got This For My Fish Tanks, Works For What I Wanted","When I saw this, I was interested in it because it has two outlets for AC power.  It has all of the cool recharging options for phones, laptops, etc, but honestly, in a power outage, the last thing I am worried about is my devices.  We have survival things to attend to.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes with all of the cords and the battery.  I highly suggest you get a case for the cords and keep it tied to the handle of this battery so it does not get lost.<br /><br />HEAVY<br />This is not SUPER heavy, but it is not lightweight either.  That means if I am going hiking, this will be significant to carry with me.  I tend to want to keep this at home.<br /><br />HOW I USE THIS<br />I use this for the AC plug.  I put in the plug of my outlet strip that my fish tanks are hooked up to.  That powers the heaters and filters and lights.  If necessary, I unplug the lights and the heaters and just let the filters run most of the time.  I have 7 tanks, so I will alternate one side of the room for an hour then the other side of the room for an hour.  (By the way, you have to remember to press the AC button to activate the AC outlets).<br /><br />HOW LONG DOES THIS WORK?<br />In a power outage we had not long ago, the power was out for several hours.  I was able to run my pumps during that time when necessary and all was well.  I have not had to use it in an extended power failure, however.<br /><br />RECHARGING<br />I don't have a solar panel at the moment, but I do have a gas generator which is one reason I got this.  If we are in an extended situation, I can recharge this and use it for the tanks while other things are using the generator.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is perfect for taking some load off when we have power outages.  With 7 aquariums this helps me to keep the filters running for various tanks alternating to keep the tanks up and running while freeing up the generator for other things in the home.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This makes me really happy to have around.  It helps a lot when we have outages and that is really worth celebrating for me.  We tend to have seasons of outages and things like this are a must.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61swrCGTEZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61swrCGTEZL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61swrCGTEZL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0915HFDTC,B0915HFDTC,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,2021-09-15 16:39:34.069,2,False,Funny and non aggressive conversation starter
3.0,Wish It Was A Bit More Stable For Camera (Not Using With Phone),"My daughter and I have been wanting to do work on a business we tried to start up prior to the hoopla that shut the world down.  Now that she has her own place, she wants to have some extra camera equipment to do some photos from her location so she does not have to do it from home.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes in a box.  It has a cell phone holder and a screw on adapter for a camera.<br /><br />HOW I USED THIS<br />I got this for a regular G12 camera from Canon.  It is not overly big.  This was to be for my daughter who has a larger Fuji camera.  I screwed this onto the camera and pointed it at me while I was holding something to take a photo.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br />Honestly, this is not as nice as another one I have used in the past.  I found that it was not very stable just standing up, and that it was hard to get the legs to bend where I wanted them to and stay put.  It seemed like the camera was always shifting when I didn’t want it to.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />When using this for a regular small camera, this just was not as stable as I wanted it to be.  It works, but I have to fuss with it more than I should.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  This tripod is a good idea, but not nearly as strong or stable as others I have used in the past.

The flap shuts and opens easily when you pull on it.<br /><br />FIT<br />This fits his Zeeker phone very well which is about twice as thick as his Moto G Power phone he was using.  It does not slide out easily so it does not get loose when he is wearing it.<br /><br />ANY ISSUES?<br />So far my husband has been a bit frustrated in certain jobs when he wears this.  It can flip open or get in his way when he has to crawl into small spaces or maneuver into tiny spots in buildings.  He is trying to figure out a method to keep using this while not getting in his way.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This holds the new Zeeker phone for contractors.  It is a nice fit.  The only challenge is to keep it on his person while my husband tries to do sub contracting jobs.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.

I'd like it to seat a bit better/more tightly in the cigarette lighter socket, but that may be the socket and not the charger.<br /><br />My major complaint is that the power on this unit is not isolated, which means it is capable of creating a ground loop with analog audio devices, thus putting out a hum. This is disappointed for a device of this kind, even if analog audio is considerably more rare these days than it used to be. I have a much less expensive USB DC-DC buck converter which I tied in elsewhere in the car, and that does not have any such issue. Indeed this is how I know the noise is from the Anker - the exact same setup on the buck converter, which is connected to the same socket, has no issue were as the Anker has noise where ever it is connected. This necessitates the use of an isolator somewhere else in my setup.<br /><br />If you don't care about the noise, then there's no problem, this is a good car charger.

5.0,No issues so far ...,"I prefer these elastic bands for my Series 6 Apple Watch as I use it for monitoring O2, pulse, exercise, etc., and it needs to fit securely on my wrist.  Elastic bands allow for more flexibility in terms of how tight the band is worn, so this works well for me.<br /><br />I purchased this set of 2 bands (the multi-colored ""rainbow""-ish ones) mostly for the colors -- we're heading into spring here in the Pacific NW, which means our gray cloudy chilly days will soon be replaced by less-gray sunnier warmer days -- with the burst of spring color that follows.  It just seemed fitting to replace my gray stretchy band with a multi-colored stretchy band.<br /><br />In terms of quality, I have no complaints at all.  The band stays secure -- it doesn't loosen with wearing (I think another review mentioned that -- it hasn't happened in my case).  The ""clasp"" (more like a sliding size adjustor) stays put, and no metal touches my skin (I'm kind of allergic to some metals) -- no discomfort there at all.  Many versions of this type of stretchy band have plastic size adjustors which kind of cheapens the look in my opinion.<br /><br />No problems at all with these -- I like them a lot and will likely purchase another set for summer wear.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Lw-gmW5pL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Lw-gmW5pL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Lw-gmW5pL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B09PMRX75P,B09GG6NC6N,AHRGTIMQO47C2VLJILIDU53BQKSA,2022-02-27 20:40:29.233,2,True,Very basic.

The other goes in my emergency travel/""hospital"" bag.  Unfortunately, I've had to make several ER trips over the past 1.5 years that have resulted in hospital admission -- and while I always have my iPhone with me, I haven't had the means to recharge it, depending on friends or hospital staff to help out until I can my hands on a charging cable/etc.  I now maintain a ""grab and go"" bag for those times when I'm headed off somewhere where I might need to recharge my phone, packing a few toiletries, nightclothes, etc. AND this charger plus a charging cable or two.  I'll be checking it every month and recharging it as needed so that if I need to head off to the hospital, it will be fully charged.<br /><br />I like that it also has the flashlight feature -- although I always have flashlights laying around the apartment -- but it never hurts to have more.<br /><br />Honestly, I have no complaints about this at all.  It charges both iPhone 12 mini and IPad Pro multiple times on a single charge, so it works perfectly as far as I'm concerned.

Without exception, the Friendly Swede styluses are clearly superior to the several other brands I've tried.<br /><br />I’ve used rubber tips and fiber tips and prefer the fiber tips.  This brand comes out on top in both versions, but it’s especially evident of the fiber tip styluses.  They “register” as far as immediate recognition much faster and cleaner than the alternatives I've tried.  I do quite a lot of fine detail work.  With other brands, I would need to touch/drag multiple times before it actually selected or moved text or item.  Not so with the Friendlly Swede.  It works every time with no need to repeat the gestures.<br /><br />The multipacks are a good bargain as you get extra replacement tips (and instructions on how to swap out the bad tip for a new one).  I like to tuck an extra stylus in my travel bag just in case I misplace one (yes, it has happened before).<br /><br />This will be my “go-to” brand for styluses in the future -- no more succumbing to the temptation of a lower-price “bargain.”  You really do get what you pay for.",[],B07STJ6FK5,B07CMG8PB4,AHRGTIMQO47C2VLJILIDU53BQKSA,2022-05-09 07:09:05.447,0,True,Math for Fun

5.0,A valuable tool for professional video from your phone!,"[[VIDEOID:e1c57ba1dee06e198768d7b37b29c652]] I got this SMOOTH 5 gimbal from Zhiyun for some video that I will be shooting of our new patio construction. It's a big project and I wanted some good documentation of it for my Yelp review of the company that's doing the installation. It took me a while to make my selection. The SMOOTH 5 won, with it's features, benefits and a great low price for such a professional tool.<br /><br />This gimbal is like my drones, complex, but worth every minute you spend doing the set up and programming. First, you have to learn how to hold it. Any hand held gimbal needs to be held where the handle is as vertical as possible at all times. Once you figure out all of the controls and features, it becomes much simpler to operate. Being able to 'point and shoot', using the controls on the gimbal to operate the camera is freakin' awesome. I would write a book, trying to go into detail about all of the functions.<br /><br />I practiced a while, before I actually got a video that I felt I could share here. You can see that, despite my unsteady gate and movement, the gimbal kept the video smooth and steady at all times.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this gimbal and will be using it, A LOT!","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tG07-F+UL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tG07-F+UL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tG07-F+UL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LO+bdaQ4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LO+bdaQ4L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LO+bdaQ4L._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fmbcPfBCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fmbcPfBCL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fmbcPfBCL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xPcVKHMeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xPcVKHMeL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xPcVKHMeL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B09LV5XH2D,B09LV5XH2D,AHTDYGXHONM2BHENDRMKMC34ZZZA,2022-05-03 12:16:24.711,9,True,Georgie in Luck for Once (Or is She?)

5.0,I can finally dump the land line!,"Okay, first I have to say that I am VERY happy with this purchase. It gets five stars from me.<br /><br />Now, I'll give you my story. When we first moved to this area, the cell phone signal was great. But, over the years, it's gotten worse and worse. The explanation I got from the carrier was that they couldn't keep up with the population growth and get enough bandwidth to provide decent service to all the customers.<br /><br />Central Texas has been booming. None of the infrastructure is growing fast enough to meet the needs. Our cell phone service provider is no exception. It got to the point where we couldn't rely on our cell service at all, in our own home. We had to carry our cordless land line phones with us all the time. It was very frustrating.<br /><br />Based on my brother-in-laws experience and recommendations, I decided to try a signal booster. After doing WEEKS of research, I decided on this one from HiBoost. It took me a while to decide. These things aren't cheap.<br /><br />The installation and setup of this system is complex and requires a good amount of work. If you're not technically inclined, a regular handyman and able to climb ladders, roofs and do a lot of physical work, I recommend you get someone to do this for you. I'm 68 years old. But, still very physically active and very handy with tools and technical projects. So, I was able to do it myself.<br /><br />The entire kit is very well engineered, designed and built with top quality materials and components.  The one thing that they don't include is a roof top antenna mast. There are several economical models available on Amazon. I was fortunate that my Dish antenna mast was close enough to an entry point that I could use it, instead of mounting another mast on the roof.  The installation was somewhat easy.<br /><br />You need to lay out all the cables and components first, figure out how long the runs are and where to mount what. They provide a small diameter 'window' cable, so you don't have to drill through a wall.<br /><br />The best way to program it requires two people, one reading the signal strength on the amplifier and another to adjust the receiver. They also have an app that allows one person to do it. But, the two person method is preferred.<br /><br />The results are awesome. I went from one bar of reception in the house, to FOUR bars. Outside, I had two bars. You need to understand that, if you don't have any signal where you are, this device won't help. But, if you have ANY signal at all, this will definitely increase that signal and provide greater coverage in your home.<br /><br />I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mn4kmRZWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mn4kmRZWL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mn4kmRZWL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711MwMKmGML._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711MwMKmGML._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711MwMKmGML._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nyt1K6+jL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nyt1K6+jL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nyt1K6+jL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81aDjuYeS1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81aDjuYeS1L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81aDjuYeS1L._SL256_.jpg'}]",B07GRBV1XZ,B0C3M446X8,AHTDYGXHONM2BHENDRMKMC34ZZZA,2022-11-08 20:55:42.982,12,True,"I should have loved it, but it was just so so..... 2/2.5"

I put a piece of paper inside to make sure it did not get wet.<br /><br />I hope my pics and review were helpful to you.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B18FXQXbPSS._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B18FXQXbPSS._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B18FXQXbPSS._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1JMqa5r1cS._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1JMqa5r1cS._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1JMqa5r1cS._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1cjhD1Gp4S._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1cjhD1Gp4S._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1cjhD1Gp4S._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1kvPVRlyAS._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1kvPVRlyAS._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1kvPVRlyAS._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1zXGTxQo2S._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1zXGTxQo2S._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1zXGTxQo2S._SL256_.jpg'}]",B098JRNQ5H,B0C1FPW688,AHTLG4HMRAKA2PV64QS2LL2RSOHA,2021-07-23 11:57:37.838,2,True,The recipient loved it.
5.0,Very sleek and crystal clear!,"[[VIDEOID:40a2bafddff79cf243bb6183303c6a06]] I purchased this MTVOOX and I had a good experience in the past with this brand. This case not only protects the corners of my phone but also has a ""lip"" to protect the front as well when lying down flat on a surface like a table. The case itself is a strong sturdy plastic rubbery type feel and is snug on my phone even after taking my phone out of the case many times. Fits well over the buttons exactly as they should.

5.0,Works as expected. Good quality,"Comes with vent clip or windshield mount. I prefer the suction mount instead as I don't like my a/c or heat blowing in the back of my phone and battery. The suction on this charger stand is really strong and has a clamp clip as well to lock it on place.<br />One of the interesting features I found is that the charger as an automated powered clamp. When you put the phone into the charging pad the clips automatically close to the desired size of your phone. No more fiddling and closing clamps. You may love it, or even hate this feature at it's a drop harder to take it out of the cradle. There is a side button you press and it opens the clamps automatically to remove your phone, but when the clamps open your phone will fall out.<br />It has fast charging but you must make sure you have the latest high speed cable and adapters to get the fastest charge. Overall, an excellent charger compared to the many I have purchased in the past by other brands.<br />I hope this review and pics were of help to you.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61j5ub-EcWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61j5ub-EcWL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61j5ub-EcWL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717i1i+jp4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717i1i+jp4L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717i1i+jp4L._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HUO9oUdlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HUO9oUdlL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HUO9oUdlL._SL256_.jpg'}, {'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gbaRM8ikL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gbaRM8ikL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gbaRM8ikL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B08D5XJTJS,B0B67V1WQN,AHTLG4HMRAKA2PV64QS2LL2RSOHA,2023-01-19 16:16:28.000,0,True,Pretty straightforward with enough details for beginners - intermediate

It fits my phone snuggly. I feel that it is protecting it well. It is 2 pieces that easily snap together. It's a little bulkier than my previous phone case, but it's not too bad.

This is nice enough to set out on your desk while working.  The leather on it is a nice touch and doesn't seem to affect the output from the coils.  It doesn't get as hot as a lot of others tend to and my phone doesn't get nearly as hot either however,  I don't use fast charge on my devices.  I did turn it on just to see the difference and fast charge certainly is faster and only gets slightly hotter, but I am old school and believe that a slower more stable charge is better but this is configurable in your device settings.<br /><br />Great job with this one.

3.0,Not sturdy enough for rough handling,"There is no information in the product description as to where these cases are manufactured. I assume it is *not* the US, or the seller would have been strongly advertising that fact as a highly desirable feature in the US market.<br /><br />These small carrying cases are all the same black color, but four of them each has a different color for their edging: red, yellow, aqua and purple. There is also a matching carabiner of those same four colors, as well as a fifth one that is black to go with the plain black case.<br /><br />I have a lot of earbuds and an MP3 player lying around the house which did not come with their own carrying case. And though some of my Bluetooth headphones came with a case, their cases are not designed, as these are, to attach to a belt loop, a purse handle, or a key ring. This case works well for all of them, other than my Bluetooth sports headphones which have an ear loop. I can put them in one of these cases, but it is a very tight fit.<br /><br />My only real complaint about these cases is their zippers. I struggled with some of the zippers, though not all of them, while trying to get them to open and close. Due to the relatively cheap price of these cases, I did not expect fantastic quality, so I wasn’t entirely shocked. These cases are obviously inexpensively made, and it takes time, effort and careful attention to install zippers properly. Since so many manufacturers of cheap consumer goods keep their prices down by cutting corners on employee working conditions in factories, it is not surprising to me that zippers would become a source of product fail due to forcing those employees to rush through their work in order to meet employer quotas. In addition, the way these cases are packed for shipment—fully unzipped, laid out wide open, and stacked one inside the other—is very likely an additional factor contributing to zipper fail, because it puts strain on the zippers when held in that position for a long time.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91BZy+GG24L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91BZy+GG24L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91BZy+GG24L._SL256_.jpg'}]",B07QTX4XVX,B07QTX4XVX,AHW7ETGBKGX6DCG2LBAG5YAXU46A,2020-06-07 21:59:52.028,1,False,Man vs. Militia
